This game is a realistic two-dimensional mass-spring network, which simulates physical bodies (such as ships) floating in water. You can punch holes in an object, slice it, apply forces to it, and smash it with bomb explosions. Once water starts rushing inside the object, it will start sinking and, if you're lucky enough, it will start breaking up!
<p/>
Our philosophy in making this game is to simulate the real world as closely as possible. Each new release adds new ways in which particles interact among themselves and with the world that surrounds them; as of this release, Floating Sandbox contains the following simulations:
<ul>
<li>Gravity</li>
<li>Buoyancy - both underwater and in the atmosphere</li>
<li>Static pressure - hydrostatic pressure and atmospheric pressure</li>
<li>Drag - both underwater and in the atmosphere</li>
<li>Thermodynamics - with melting and combustion</li>
<li>Ocean floor impacts</li>
<li>Wind and waves</li>
</ul>

Once you load a ship, you can do quite a few things with it.<br/>
First of all, you can use the <b>Smash</b> <img src="../../Resources/smash_cursor_down.png"/> tool to punch holes in it. The longer you keep the mouse button pressed, the larger the hole you can punch! Then there's the <b>Slice</b> <img src="../../Resources/chainsaw_cursor_up.png"/> tool, with which you can cut your ship into slices; hold the <img src="../../Help/ks_shift.png"/> key to lock the direction of the cut.<br/>
Use the <b>Blast</b> <img src="../../Resources/blast_cursor_up_1.png"/> tool instead to generate an explosive force field; the <img src="../../Help/ks_shift.png"/> key shortens the blast dynamics for a more focused effect.<br/>
The <b>Electric Spark</b> <img src="../../Resources/electric_spark_cursor_up.png"/> tool sends jolts throughout the ship, causing the damage that jolts normally do - heat, burning, and interfering with electronics. Hold the <img src="../../Help/ks_shift.png"/> key to boost the electric arcs' lengths.<br/>
The <b>Attract</b> <img src="../../Resources/drag_cursor_up_plus.png"/> tool and the <b>Swirl</b> <img src="../../Resources/swirl_cursor_up_cw.png"/> tool apply radial and tangent forces, respectively. Also with these tools, the longer you keep the mouse button pressed, the stronger the forces become. You can invert the direction of the forces with the <img src="../../Help/ks_shift.png"/> key.<br/>
The <b>Pin</b> <img src="../../Resources/pin_cursor.png"/> tool allows you to "freeze" a point of the ship: once the point is frozen, its velocity becomes zero and its position never changes. It's best to increase the overall strength of the ship via the <i>Simulator Settings</i> window when you use this tool, or else the frozen point will quickly break under the enormous stress brought by neighboring points. An individual pin may be removed by applying the tool to the same point again, and <b>all</b> pins may be removed by pressing the <img src="../../Help/ks_shift.png"/> key while applying the tool.<br/>
With the <b>Move</b> <img src="../../Resources/move_cursor_up.png"/> tool you can move (or rotate, if pressing the <img src="../../Help/ks_shift.png"/> key) parts of a ship, while the <b>Move All</b> <img src="../../Resources/move_all_cursor_up.png"/> tool allows you to move (or rotate) an <i>entire</i> ship.<br/>
With the <b>Pick'n'Pull</b> <img src="../../Resources/pliers_cursor_up.png"/> tool you may pick a particle and move it around - but be careful, if you pull too quick it'll break!<br/>
The <b>Inject Pressure</b> <img src="../../Resources/air_tank_cursor_up.png"/> tool allows you to inject pressure into a ship, or to remove pressure from it when pressing the <img src="../../Help/ks_shift.png"/> key; similarly, the <b>Flood</b> <img src="../../Resources/flood_cursor_up.png"/> tool allows you to inject water into a ship, or to extract water from it when pressing the <img src="../../Help/ks_shift.png"/> key.<br/>
The <b>HeatBlaster</b> <img src="../../Resources/heat_blaster_heat_cursor_up.png"/> tool may be used to add heat to parts of the ship, sending them dangerously close to their burning point; pressing the <img src="../../Help/ks_shift.png"/> key makes the tool <i>remove</i> heat instead.<br/>
After a ship has sunk to the bottom or has burnt for some time, its structure gets rusted and charred; you can use the <b>Scrub</b> <img src="../../Resources/scrub_cursor_up.png"/> tool to clean the dirt away. Pressing the <img src="../../Help/ks_shift.png"/> key will turn the Scrub tool into a <b>Rot</b> tool, instead.<br/>
The <b>WaveMaker</b> <img src="../../Resources/wave_maker_cursor_up.png"/> tool may be used to manually generate waves, while the <b>Adjust Terrain</b> <img src="../../Resources/terrain_adjust_cursor_up.png"/> tool allows you to customize the ocean floor, creating abysses and islands as you see fit. Press the <img src="../../Help/ks_shift.png"/> key to lock the terrain change horizontally.<br/>
The <b>Scare</b> <img src="../../Resources/megaphone_cursor_up.png"/> tool can be used to...scare fishes away. Pressing the <img src="../../Help/ks_shift.png"/> key turns the tool into yummy fish food, causing fishes to flock to your mouse cursor.
<p/>
Finally, for the passive-aggressive types, ultimate destruction can be achieved lazily with bombs.<br/>
<b>Timer Bombs</b> <img src="../../Resources/timer_bomb_cursor.png"/> explode automatically a few seconds after having been placed, while <b>Remote Controlled Bombs</b> <img src="../../Resources/rc_bomb_cursor.png"/> and <b>Anti-Matter Bombs</b> <img src="../../Resources/am_bomb_cursor.png"/> await for you to detonate them with the <img src="../../Help/ks_d.png"/> and <img src="../../Help/ks_n.png"/> keys, respectively. <b>Impact Bombs</b> <img src="../../Resources/impact_bomb_cursor.png"/> just explode on...impact.
<p/>
If you feel remorse for the destruction you have inflicted, you may try the <b>Repair Structure</b> <img src="../../Resources/repair_structure_cursor_up.png"/> tool on the broken edges of a ship, and if you are skillful enough, you'll be able to restore the structure of the ship to its pristine condition.
<p/>
NPC's - both <i>human</i> and <i>furniture</i> - may be added via the <b>NPCs</b> menu.

You can zoom the view with the <img src="../../Help/ks_plus.png"/> and <img src="../../Help/ks_minus.png"/> keys or with your mouse's wheel, while you can pan the view using the <img src="../../Help/ks_left.png"/> <img src="../../Help/ks_up.png"/> <img src="../../Help/ks_right.png"/> <img src="../../Help/ks_down.png"/> keys. If you get lost, the <img src="../../Help/ks_home.png"/> key resets the view to its default coordinates.<br/>
Darkness and light can be adjusted with the <img src="../../Help/ks_pgup.png"/> and <img src="../../Help/ks_pgdown.png"/> keys.
