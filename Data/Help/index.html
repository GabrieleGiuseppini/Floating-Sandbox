This game is a realistic two-dimensional mass-spring network, which simulates physical bodies (such as ships) floating in water. You can punch holes in an object, slice it, apply forces to it, and smash it with bomb explosions. Once water starts rushing inside the object, it will start sinking and, if you're lucky enough, it will start breaking up!
<p/>
Our philosophy in making this game is to simulate the real world as closely as possible. Each new release adds new ways in which particles interact among themselves and with the world that surrounds them; think of gravity, buoyancy, and wind, but also bouncing when smashing on the oceean floor, and feeling drag when moving fast underwater.
<p/>
You can create your own physical objects by drawing images using colors that correspond to materials in the game's library. Each material has its own physical properties, such as mass, strength, stiffness, water permeability, sound properties, electrical properties, and so on. If you want, you can also apply a higher-resolution image to be used as a more realistic texture for the object. Once you load your object, watch it float and explore how it behaves under stress!
<p/>
The game currently comes with a few example objects - mostly ships. You can find them under the "Ships" directory.

Once you load a ship, you can do quite a few things with it.<br/>
First of all, you can use the <b>Smash</b> <img src="../Resources/smash_cursor_down.png"/> tool to punch holes in it. The longer you keep the mouse button pressed, the larger the hole you can punch! Then there's the <b>Slice</b> <img src="../Resources/chainsaw_cursor_up.png"/> tool, with which you can slice your ship.<br/>
The <b>Grab</b> <img src="../Resources/drag_cursor_up_plus.png"/> tool and the <b>Swirl</b> <img src="../Resources/swirl_cursor_up_cw.png"/> tool apply radial and tangent forces, respectively. Also with these tools, the longer you keep the mouse button pressed, the stronger the forces become. You can invert the direction of the forces with the <img src="ks_shift.png"/> key.<br/>
The <b>Pin</b> <img src="../Resources/pin_cursor.png"/> tool allows you to "freeze" a point of the ship: once the point is frozen, its velocity becomes zero and its position never changes. It's best to increase the overall strength of the ship via the <i>Settings Dialog</i> when you use this tool, or else the frozen point will quickly break under the enormous stress brought by neighboring points. A pin can be removed by applying the tool to the same point again.<br/>
With the <b>Move</b> <img src="../Resources/move_cursor_up.png"/> tool you can move ships around, and by pressing the <img src="ks_shift.png"/> key you
can rotate them. The <b>Flood</b> <img src="../Resources/flood_cursor_up.png"/> tool allows you to inject water into a ship, or to extract water from a ship when pressing the <img src="ks_shift.png"/> key.
<p/>
Finally, for the passive-aggressive types, ultimate destruction can be achieved lazily with bombs.<br/>
<b>Timer Bombs</b> <img src="../Resources/timer_bomb_cursor.png"/> explode automatically a few seconds after having been placed, while <b>Remote Controlled Bombs</b> <img src="../Resources/rc_bomb_cursor.png"/> and <b>Anti-Matter Bombs</b> <img src="../Resources/am_bomb_cursor.png"/> await for you to detonate them with the <img src="ks_d.png"/> and <img src="ks_n.png"/> keys, respectively. <b>Impact Bombs</b> <img src="../Resources/impact_bomb_cursor.png"/> just explode on...impact.

You can zoom the view with the <img src="ks_plus.png"/> and <img src="ks_minus.png"/> keys or with your mouse's wheel, while you can pan the view using the <img src="ks_left.png"/> <img src="ks_up.png"/> <img src="ks_right.png"/> <img src="ks_down.png"/> keys. If you get lost, the <img src="ks_home.png"/> key resets the view to its default coordinates.<br/>
Darkness and light can be adjusted with the <img src="ks_pgup.png"/> and <img src="ks_pgdown.png"/> keys.
