- Release:
	= Change LinkedIn link
	= Buoyancy fix:
		+ test with hack what would happen if all non-hull materials were 1/nth of the mass
		= If ok:
			= Before unhack: fix ships:
				+ Do Masts and investigate mass effect on breakage
				+ Fix Titanic:
					+ Lighter rudder
					+ Also generally Lighter?
					+ Stronger under funnels (make tin stronger?)
				- Fix Base III: make it float
				- Fix default ship: just lighter
				- Fix cargo ship
					- Lighter back
					- Weaker supports to containers
					- Stronger mid-top material
				- Fix Carnival - lighter
			- Rewrite buoyancy code - use WaterMass
			- Change materials
				- Add density = [copy from current hack] 1/6th for hull, 1/(6*10or4)
				- Material loading: just store mass*density at mass
				- Materials Template: redo
			+ Fix strength adjust
		- Add to change list
	= Make some ships
		+ Copy three balls
		+ Make ShipTools, -quantize verb
		+ Make some stiffer columns of steel, iron, titanium, etc.
			+ materials: also order rows based on mass
			+ Do last steel column stiff
			+ Iron and Wood
				+ Switch stiff wood with new one
					+ Switch also Titanic
						+ Test
			+ Add "f=..." to template or better "M:S:F"
			+ Test newest ship
		- Antennas
			- Draft with barrels
		- That warship
		- Call .shp parts ".png.dat"
			- Rename via git
			- Edit .shp files
	- Build and release 1.2.0
	- PinnedPoints below
	- Post to forum
	- Add to gamejolt

- Technical Debt:
	+ Move definition of ElementIndex et al into GameTypes.h
	- Move also pinned points to a PinnedPoints class, just like Bombs
	- Textures are json files, with world sizes, offset, and lighting boolean
		- SEE MOLESKINE
		- Then:
			- Change bomb rendering: takes vector of frame indices, no optionals needed
			- Remove hardcoded sizes and offsets
				- Cloud size
				- Water size
				- Land size
				- Bombs sizes and offsets

- Optimizations:	
	- See if can avoid other IsDeleted checks, via zero'ing of coefficients
	- UpdatePointForces:
		- Precalculate things that do not depend on position nor velocity
			- Stored either in buffers (if we go for exploded Pos, Vel, etc.) or in Point (if we don't go for that)
			- Technically, would have to store separately effectiveMassMultiplier (*Mass) and effectiveBuoyancy (*Mass)
				- Test: but could cheat and use water height based on initial positions only, in which case
				  we store directly StaticForce == Gravity + Water Drag (?REALLY?)
				  - StaticForce used directly in Integrate() added to Force
					- Or better if added to Force at UpdatePointDynamics()?
	- Split Spring::WaterPermeability in two, with pre-calculated values:
		- WaterGravitationFactor
		- WaterPropagationFactor
	- GravitateWater:
		- Calculate once and for all cos theta's at first iteration
			- !!! Actually, calculate WaterGravityFactorA = dt*0.6*(1+cos_theta)/2, WaterGravityFactorB = -dt*0.6*(1-cos_theta)/2
				float cos_theta_select = (1.0f + cos_theta) / 2.0f;
		                float correction = 0.60f * cos_theta_select * pointA->GetWater() - 0.60f * (1.0f - cos_theta_select) * pointB->GetWater();
		                correction *= GameParameters::SimulationStepTimeDuration<float>;
			- Test (check disassembly) with templated lambda (Spring const &)->void
				- First one calculates factors and stores them in Spring
				- All others empty
				- All iters take factors from Spring after calling lambda
	- If SSE2 works, see if can parallelize also:
		- BalancePressure, GravitateWater, SpringDynamics
			- See shuffled loading and storing of 4 arbitrary floats in ETH deck
	- Water and Land interpolations:
		- 1: see if it's better to store delta's and/or other pre-calculated things
		- 2: see if can do semi-integer x-axis interpolation


- Gfx:
	- Draw better parts connected only by ropes 
		- Change connected component detection by not propagating from a "spring only" to a "body"
			- In practice: flood the *edge* network, not the spring network, and don't propagate
			  if coming from edge with zero triangles to an edge with !=0 triangles
	- Option to enable drawing of force vectors for each point
	- Texture atlas:
		- Test first if with a single texture bind per ship (which will look crappy!) there's a significant
		  performance difference
			- Check the three boxes
	- Optimizations:
		- More connected components => slower (multiple batches); try
		  to draw one single batch then, using Z buffer
			- Assign Z based on connected component ID
		- See if drawing springs & triangles with Z buffer and depth test helps (for springs' fragment shader, may be it takes 
		  shortcuts if it knows it's behind)
	- AmbientLightIntensity:
		+ Use also in RenderContext::RenderStart() for clear (sky) color
		+ Phase 1: pgup/down
		- Phase 2: with clock - TBD
	- Magnifying glass
		- https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/154811-magnifying-glass-effect
		- https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4tdXDl
	- Ocean depth bitmaps
	- Save photos (opens SaveAs FileDialog)
	- Text (for query tool):
		- see https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/blob/master/samples/opengl/pyramid/pyramid.cpp
	- Bug: bombs et al fade more rapidly than ship when ambient light goes away

- Dynamics:

	- Ephemeral Particles:
		- Carve out room at tail of Points for ephemeral particles
			- No need to mark as deleted to hide them
			- Tail managed as circular queue, used when creating new ones - eventually smothering oldest
			  ones (started more anciently, but not necessarily closest to death as each has own lifetime)
				- TODO: not really circular queue, dead not last must be reused
			- Points has new buffers:
				- EphemeralType (uint8 enum)
					- None (set at non-ephemeral and at dead ephimerals)
					- Sparkle
				- EphemeralLife (float between 0.0 and 1.0)
				- EphemeralXTODOX: union of structs
					- SparkleXTODOX:
						- TODO
			- Smothering done by Ship (UpdateEphemeralParticles) as:
				- TODO:
			- Points methods:
				- TODO: create/kill, create has first overload that takes all the dynamics params, including Material, and
				  type-specific params
		- Rendering:
			- Points::UploadEphemeralParticles():
				- (Ship)RenderContext::TODOHERE
	- Do chainsaw sparkles with Ephemeral Particles
		- At Ship::Chainsaw
	- Test:
		- Self-adjustment of kSpring and kDamp based off paper's formula (H and L bounds)
		- Debug to see if bounds ever exceeded
	- See if can draw a bit more often
	- Frontier:
		- Only for non-rope points - rope points never take part in frontier
		- Preliminaries:
			- Make sure endpoints in triangle are always in CW order
			- In order to correctly draw dangling (i.e. same connected component) parts on top of all of the connected component's 
			  frontiers, we'd need to have the dangling parts disconnected from the connected component, which means that we should
			  not follow ropes during connected component detection
				- Still vulnerable to dangling parts not connected via ropes (e.g. masts) though: frontier would be drawn on top of it
				- Might get away with drawing frontiers - *enlarged* - before all of the rest? The enlarged part would be visible
				  only through holes and around external frontiers
		
		- TODO: all the following might have to be revisited
		- Realize that a node can belong to up to 4 frontiers (center of 4 holes)
			- And a point deletion might cause a merge of the four
		- Frontier is set of points, marked as frontier, and connected to each other via 
		  nextInFrontier * and prevInFrontier * (in CW order) 
		- Algo:
			- There are multiple frontiers, 0 is external, N is internal, isolated
			- Calculate frontier at ship create, based off structural matrix, using geometry
			- At each point deletion:
				- 2 cases: OR: only later check if one of the connected points is already a frontier 
				  (a deleted frontier point is bound to be connected to two other points of the same frontier, for each frontier)
					- Point deleted is a frontier point:
						- TODO
					- Point deleted is NOT a frontier point:
						- All its connected points become a frontier
						- If one of the connected points is already a frontier, then the new frontier points
						  take that frontierId
						- TODO
	- Water drag 
		- The one already there assumes velocity always normal to surface, but we should consider surface normal instead
	- Experiment with:
		- Runge-Kutta
		- Semi-implicit Euler (https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Michael.Manzke/CS7057/cs7057-1516-14-MassSpringSystems-mm.pdf)
	- Water:
		- Test forcing incoming water @ LeakWater to be max 1.0
		- Sinking detection is broken - it currently only considers total water that entered the ship, which comes proportionally to external
		  water pressure; all this water could be confined to a tiny volume, and yet we trigger sinking
			- Option 1: make it based on total number of points that have water instead, i.e. wet points
				- ...which requires Points to keep track of point's water going from 0.0 to > 0.0, at all possible
				  avenues of change (LeakWater, BalancePressure, etc.)
				- Or can just be calculated at end of each update with simple pass through water buffer
			- Option 2: make it based on total number of points whose Y is underwater
				- Could be done @ Ship::UpdatePoint() when the count of underwater points reaches threshold for the first time
					- Just reset count before loop
				- HOWEVER: a big part of the ship could be below water but dry...
				- So: should try a combination of current mTotalWater and 3/4ths of points below water
		+ Did original game propagate water also through hull springs? YES. How did hull thin dividers work? THEY DIDN'T WORK
		+ Add Point::Hull Characteristic, and don't leak/propagate(incl. gravitate) water if at least one of the two points is hull			
			+ Alternatively: just make a spring hull if one point is hull; test it
		- BalancePressure: see if shouldn't average water among two points - do we lose waves if we do so?
		- BalancePressure: use gradient, it seems we stuff too much water into points with already too much water
		- GravitateWater: try inverse visit (from H to L)
			- Requires PointerVector::rbegin,rend
		- Try directional BalancePressure?
		- Make waves with Shallow Water Equations plus breaking waves
			- And if frontier works, change height when frontier touches water for the first time
	- DestroyAt:
		- Test: Ship::SpringDestroyHandler() only destroys triangles that contain A-B
			- Should definitely make both A and B leak, as they both now have an adjacent hole
		
- Controls:
	- SettingsDialog: save settings, and defaults
		- JSON for both game & render params, assembled & saved by gamecontroller, who also loads it on startup if exists 
		- GameParameters::ToJson()->picojson::value
		- GameParameters::FromJson(picojson::value) (sets own)
		- Save Settings: saves current to personal_settings.json 
			- where? see wxwidgets or portable way
				- Standard paths: http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.1/classwx_standard_paths.html#a4752213ef4d7bdc71170b9e5c3691f0f
					- Call App::SetAppName() at startup
					- Pass user folder path to GameController at startup, so latter doesn't have to deal with wxWidgets
				+ https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3956/best-way-to-save-application-settings/3990#3990?newreg=bffd79f524c14afe84f2178cd3211a94
			- personal_settings.json loaded at startup if exists, else default_settings.json
		- Save Settings As: saves with filename, nothing else
		- Load Settings: loads with filename, changes own settings
		- Reset Settings: loads default_settings.json, changes own settings

- Sounds:
	+ Reset sound controller at ResetAndLoadShip()
	- Water rushing-in
		- Continuously-playing sound
		- Volume time-interpolated off total quantity of water that entered ships during step
			- Communicated via new event
			- Volume = -1/(Qw+1) + 1

- Histograms:
	- class Histogram
		- map<float, float in [0,1]>
	- class Statistics (various Histograms, etc.)
		- Histogram pointWaterHistogram
		- ...
	- World::GetStatistics() -> Statistics
		- Visits all points across ships, no need to merge histograms
		- Exposed by GameController as well
	- StatisticsDialog
		- Pre-created member of MainFrame
			- Has GameController
		- Shown depending on menu (like LoggingDialog)
		- exposes Update() invoked by MainFrame, always, after simulation step
		- Update(): 
			- if not visible, return;
			- Get and draw Statistics
				- Histogram control (panel? Check wx literature)

- Lights
	+ need Optional()
	+ Material:
		+ use picojson
		+ Material.ElectricalProperties (optional)
			+ type (Material::ElectricalProperties::ElectricalElementType=lamp, cable, generator)
			+ flat list of all electrical properties, some apply some don't
	+ class Lamp()
		+ points to Point and Point points optionally to ElectricalElement (base abstract of Lamp, Cable, Generator)
			+ ElectricalElement::GetType(){return mType;}: non-virtual, it's optimized by compiler
	- Move electrical components to ElectricalComponents class, an ElementContainer but also like bombs, with update and state machines
	  (but no render)
		- Buffer of pointers
		- Buffer of ElementIndex of points
			- Same at Points: electrical elements are indices
		- Add additional buffers that might simplify electrical connectivity test, e.g. Type and VisitedGen
	- Current Propagation Algo (Ship::UpdateCurrentConnectivity()):
		+ create new generation seq number; if new is 0 => 1
		- Consider adding a new "ConductsElectricity" buffer to Springs, set to true or folse at Add() depending
		  on whether or not both endpoints' materials have ConductsElectricity=true
			- ConductsElectricity replaces all the other useless electrical properties
			- This simplifies current connectivity graph visit
			- Alternative is to check at visit time whether other endpoint has a non-None attached ElectricalElement index,
			  but this means lots of useless cache misses for getting point's buffer content (only a small percentage of points
			  have an ElectricalElement attached)
		- ElectricalElement has SetVisited(curGen), bool IsVisited(curGen), operating on buffers
		- @Sip::Update, electrical section: if mAreElementsDirty: invoke UpdateCurrentConnectivity()
			- Visit whole electrical graph, as:
			- For each generator point:
				- if not visited=>flood all connected ElectricalElements (of any type) from here
					- Only start from a generator if its wetness < threshold
						- But still mark it as visited
					- For each node: set to visited
					- No need to have a visited set, just call ElElement->IsVisited(curGen)
			- Then, lamps will be considered lighted if visited at this generation
		- OLD: generators and cumulative current calculation:
			- visit all generator points and count the points in their graphs; for each connected component:
				- # nodes in component => current
				- propagate from each of these points to all adjacent cables until light
				- at a light: add up all incoming currents (compare seq number to decide whether to zero or not) 
				  and then lower them by distance(==ohm), and then update gen number of lamp
		- Then, ElectricalElements::Update(currentGenerationNumber)
			- Calls Lamp->Update(currentGenerationNumber):
				- TODO: draw state machine
				- Looks at own (generationVisitNumber, state) and:
					- Updates state
					- Eventually starts flicker state machine:
						+ Based off clock time, not simulation step
						- iff: state==On and generationVisitNumber != current
						- Invokes IGameEventHandler->OnLightFlicker()
						- Sets gen_number = 0
							- If revisited, state machine will transition to lighted again
						- Flicker state machine is based off clock time, not simulation step
							- Use random choices
					- Sets own lightIntensity = f(generationVisitNumber, state, flicker state machine)
		- Then, go ahead with DiffuseLight as now
	+ Diffusion:
		+ Can test it by itself, by using light material and by cheating with current!
		+ After current propagation:
			+ Zero out mLight of each point (use generation sequence number? useful for other Point properties?)
				+ No, easier and probably faster to do it in same pass as LeakWater - LeakWaterAndZeroLight()
		+ Diffusion: propagate mLight to adjacent points (incl. other lamps),
		  inv. proportional to distance^2, with a graph flood stopping at max distance
		+ Point.GetColour() takes also into account mLight (from itself, not from lamp) 
                  and makes alpha blend just like water
		+ Need "off" color to use at lamp point when Lamp is off (different than structural color),
		  used when rendering point in springs/triangles/points
			+ Not used when using textures, of course
			+ Needs material's Color to split in StructuralColor and RenderColor (set to the same except for lamps)
	- Diffusion improvement: see if can simply add light (rather than max'ing it)
		- Need to ensure sum is always < 1.0
			- May be via adding +1 to distance? 
	

- Smoke
	- Smoke-material points, using ephemeral particles

- Multiple ships:
	- Better after collision detection
	- When ship loaded (added):
		- World adds it not to mShips, but as opt<Ship> mPendingShip
			- Not considered in Update(), but considered in Render()
		- MainFrame begins new PendingShipPlace tool
			- OnMouseMove: tell GameController (->World) mouse position as GameController::MovePendingShipTo(screen coords)
				- Ship::MoveTo(world x, y): 
					- Moves all Points by (x,y)-mCurrentRepresentativePosition
						- Ship::mCurrentRepresentativePosition (init'd as {0,0}) tracks current "center"
					- mCurrentRepresentativePosition = (x,y)
			- OnLDown:
				- Tell GameController (DropPendingShip(x, y)) which:
					- Tells World via World::DropPendingShip(x, y):
						- Final Ship::MoveTo()
						- Move ship from mPendingShip into mShips
					- Fires IGameEventHandler::OnPendingShipPlaced(shipId)
						- EventTicker: say this and other Reset/Load
						- SoundController: play sound
				- Stop PendingShipPlace tool

				+ Phase 2: Change all ElementContainer::ElementIndex into ElementIndex
				+ Structure of buffers:
					+ For SSE2, need to be simple floats
					+ For handling, need to be structured
				+ Buffers are class Buffer
					+ Need to be mem-aligned
					+ cctor(size)
					+ data()/size()/emplace_back()
					+ uq_ptr
			+ They expose buffer getters for each buffer (as the structured type, e.g. vec2f *, or PointNetwork *, or float * for lonely scalars)
				+ e.g. vec2f* GetPositionBuffer()
				+ When needed also exposed as floats as well (e.g. Position, for Integrate())
					+ e.g. float* GetPositionBufferAsFloat()
					+ size math left to caller
			+ When needed, they expose getters and generally operations on single elements, via 32-bit index argument (aliased as ElementIndex)
				+ e.g. void Destroy(ElementIndex)
				+ e.g. float GetMass(ElementIndex)
			+ Destroy(ElementIndex) takes care of telling ship that element count is dirty
				+ Phase 3: set directly in Ship at initiation of Destroy chain, whenever we know we destroy something
					+ Do at Spring::UpdateStrain: returns bool, true if destroyed
					+ Do at tool's Destroy
					+ Then get rid of two-phase ship cctor - plain cctor with moved ElementRepo's
						+ So can also remove move assignment at Points

		+ Try Adjancency rearc:

 for the fact that each arc 
			  would now be visited only once

			+ However, for electrical elements we still want to visit the spring-connected graph,
			  regardless of hull-ness this time;
			  we then want each point to know its N attached springs (arcs), which
			  we maintain as a vector<Spring *> (there's max 8)
				+ Actually: FixedSizeVector<TElement, Size>, w/erase that shifts and returns bool
				+ Remove: use vector::erase(std::remove(val)), or self-done for just one
				+ Adjust GravitateWater and BalancePressure
 for the fact that each arc 
			  		is now visited only once

					+ GravitateWater: change to visit springs, and do realize that one of the points

					+ Exactly one material with isRope=true
					+ Color is #000000
					+ No colors clash, and no colors fall within rope range
				+ Replace in GameController, ResourceLoader
				+ Remove ropeMaterial kung-fu @ Ship::Create and use material->IsRope
				+ GameController also gives rope renderColour to RenderContext at cctor
					+ Which sets shader's hardcoded parameter
	+ Try light diffusion rearc:
		+ No more at C++, but rather in OpenGL as in the following example (written for ShipTriangles only but valid also for springs 
		  and points):
			+ Prerequisite: draw ship triangles by connected component (see above)
			+ Turn off diffusion
			+ For each component: pass array of all lamps in that component; each lamp has {x, y, intensity};
			+ Draw each connected component N times (use additive blending), once for each lamp, 
			  each time passing the single lamp properties as uniform to shaders, 
			  which calculate distance and do final light blending
				+ Check right way of doing blending

				+ y:
					+ To LandBuffer
					+ To WaterBuffer
			+ RenderLand()
			+ RenderWater()
		+ Land (sand)
			+ bottom is not anymore a param but it's filled by RenderLadn(.) with +/- mWorldHeight/2
				+ only param is x and y (world y)
			+ texture coordinates are world coordinates
			+ Magic number is based on desired tile world size
		+ Water
			+ Use "water transparency" uniform in shader that sets alpha value in result of texture
			+ Make texture stretch wrt vertical height of water strip
			+ Change map, this one's ugly
		+ Clouds
			+ Use N textures, each has own rectangular size
			+ RenderContext loads all available textures and uses them for the clouds, modulo
				+ ResourceLoader::LoadTexturesRgba(prefix)
					+ initProgressSink lambda 
			+ GameParameters.NumberOfClouds (constants)
			+ World takes numberOfClouds and allocates clouds buffer with random values
			+ Then, RenderContext::RenderCloudsStart()/./End()

			+ Clouds stencil: 
				+ Draw waterbuffer without texture, but reverse stencil op
		+ Ship, using second image
			+ Load ship == image or .shp (JSON)
			+ First, try naively with just point colors
				+ Doesn't work, as structural image has too little resolution
			+ RenderContext is given optional texture image (by GameController) via
			  RenderContext::AddShip(iShip, opt<ImageData>)
			  + Requires RenderContext::ResetWorld()
				+ Simply clears vector of ShipRenderContext()
					+ ShipRenderContext contains everything ship-related
						+ Rename springs and triangles to "Elements"
						+ Touch points with outside world:
							+ Parameters (booleans, render factors)
							+ OrthoMatrix
							+ Helpers
				+ No need to reset others (land, water, clouds) as their numbers, positions, and data will be given
				  at the next Render() from scratch
					+ But it could easily by re-creating uq_ptr<XYZRenderContext()>
				+ Call from GameController
			  + Adds ship with opt<ImageData> in arg
				+ If specd, cctor creates <OpenGLTexture mElementTexture> and uploads immediately
				+ mShipTextureCoordinatesVBO and other texture machinery is created at startup anyway (if any)
				+ No need for std::optional<ImageData> TextureImageData
			  + Remembers if ship has texture via mElementTexture
			  + Catch exceptions at all interactions of MainFrame with GameController, and display DialogBox
			  + ResourceLoader::LoadShipDefinition: need to make paths abs wrt .shp path
			  + Refactor to World::CreateShip() -> ID -> Ship::Create()
			  + Land and Water texture names: do own, not from array
			  + Always unbind texture2d after a render
			+ Also, later, RenderContext is also given textureCoords,
			  i.e. a buffer of texture X's and Y's (i.e. initial points' coords) for
			  each of the ship points (i.e. aligned with the point buffer which will be continuosly uploaded)
			  + TextureCoords created by Ship::Create (always), stored into Ship, and given to RenderContext
			    (which uploads it, always) once and for all at the same time as colors (i.e. when IsPointCountDirty)
			+ If a texture is associated with the ship, RenderContext uses a different shader for ShipTriangles
			+ Krafting:
				+ Y offset for initial drop
				+ Remove one layer of hull from bottom, but see how much it bends afterwards

	+ OpenGL optimizations:
		+ Try without buffer population: 			
			+ Point has vec2f * const mPosition and vec2f * const mColour, pointing into two fixed buffers
				+ vectors are packed (static_assert on contiguous 2 or 3)
				+ Point does not live in PointerContainer but in std::uq_ptr<Point>[]
					+ Delete does nothing (Destroy does relationships though), just marks it
			+ Point also has mElementIndex, queried by springs and triangles when rendering themselves
				+ Can make Ship::Render const again, then
			+ Pointers to fixed buffers (as arrays of vectors) are owned by Ship and
			  are given by Ship to RenderContext at each Render via 
			  RenderContext::UploadVertices(vec2f*, vec3f*, count)
			+ RenderContext usage of two buffers at each DrawElements:
				glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertexBuffer);
				glVertexAttribPointer(vertexPositionAttribute, 3,  GL_FLOAT, false, 0, 0);
				glEnableVertexAttribArray(vertexPositionAttribute);
				glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, colorBuffer);
				glVertexAttribPointer(vertexColorAttribute, 4, GL_FLOAT, false, 0, 0);
				glEnableVertexAttribArray(vertexColorAttribute);
			+ Point's vector pointers are populated by Point::Rebase(buf1, buf2),
			  invoked by Ship at construction
				+ Rebase() uses mPointIndex (rename of mElementIndex) to calc pointers
			+ Try: could also use buffer with mLight and mWater (uploaded each time to GPU as well) to be used by V->F shader 
			  to blend fragColor with two fixed colors (water blended before ambient light, light after)
				+ F shader needs to start doing ambient light now, rather than point
				+ Need Point::CalculateWaterColorIntensity() (clamps and copies mWater to buffer), 
				  and a dummy Point::FinalizeLightColorIntensity() (dummy because mLight is already finalized)
				  + or do clamp in shader, so use mWater and mLight straight from buffer, no CalculateX() needed
				+ If we put light and water in shader, then we don't need to reupload color buffer each time
			+ Bonus: also test GPU interpolation of mLight and mWater by emitting them at vertex
		+ Plan:
			+ 0: Test with additional mLight and mWater uploaded to RenderContext (same Point struct), and fragment shader doing math
				+ F Shader needs params: ambientLightIntensity; constants: waterColor, lightColor
				+ Remove point color calculation
				+ Check perf:
					+ Before: 16
					+ After: 14.1
					+ Keep in mind that we're adding to the buffer, while later we'll remove the colors
				+ Also test bonus: GPU interpolation of mLight and mWater by emitting them at vertex

					+ Created by Ship::Create(), moved into Ship member (ElementRepository<vec3f>)

							+ Then uploads to GPU right away, with GL_STREAMING_DRAW
			+ Final:

		+ Test with same strain also for compression	
			+ And force at 0.0058
		+ Test with slightly higher stiffness - see if less bending but same breaking
	+ Realistification:
		+ Ship::Damp: damping 3 times at end should have the same effect
		+ Exploding ship:
			+ Check if higher damp factor helps: was 0.5, now 0.8

			+ Apply forces: 
				+ For each spring:
					+ Spring force (Stooke's law - need k, try fixed at first)

					+ see https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Michael.Manzke/CS7057/cs7057-1516-14-MassSpringSystems-mm.pdf for equations

				+ Drag
			+ Apply verlet integration
			+ Zero force
			+ ...do tension strain check...
			+ ...electrical and water...
		+ Improve:

			+ Gamma - from original (NOT from original, doesn't work)
			+ Better grab force:
				+ Have optional<float force, vec2f position>; at each iteration, if not none:

	+ Pin points
		+ Point::TogglePin():
			+ If pinning: set MassFactor to zero, and set velocity to zero
			+ If unpinning: recalc MassFactor (using same helper used at cctor)
		+ The entire search is implemented by Points
			+ Together with isPinned (used at search to avoid pinning pinned point), also maintains
			  stack of pinned point indices
				+ Toggle: find topmost point in stack merely within radius; if found -> toggle it & remove from stack 
				  & mark as dirty for re-upload and return true; 
				  + else: find closest non-pinned point; 
					+ if found: toggle it & add to stack & mark as dirty for re-upload & return true
					+ else: return false
				+ Destroy: also remove from stack, if there
					+ And if there, mark as dirty for re-upload
		+ Given that connected component changes affect rendering of pinned points:
			+ Move stack and mArePinnedPointsDirty back into ship, together with search logic
				+ Points gets back Pin() and Unpin()
				+ Ship::Destroy as well
			+ Pinned points are uploaded by decision of Ship
				+ Decision: if mAreElementsDirty || mArePinnedPointsDirty
				+ Ship does start & end & points
		+ ShipRenderContext: draw pinned points using texture (centered)
			+ Ship uploads coordinates and ConnectedComponentID of point
			+ ShipRenderContext: behave exactly as with StressedSprings (i.e. reset at ElementsStart()), as 
			  we're sure we'll re-upload pinned points when elements are dirty
				+ Rename as "Elements"
				+ Do with buffer
				+ Calc bounding box, centered over point, like clouds
			+ Render(): draw at very end of each connected component render, after stressed springs
			+ Redo cursor and move to \textures

			+ Returns true if points belongs to ship, so to stop search by World

			+ Random choices, Over/Underwater - NO material
				+ Update sink event

	+ Find sweet spot of stiffness and strength between bending and more strength for pinning
		+ stiff: 0.500750

	+ Cosmetics:
		+ Explain Spring's coefficients (in terms of fractionXYZ* of return-to-rest-length, etc.)
		+ Rename Points::MassFactor as IntegrationFactor and explain
	+ Is Verlet implemented right?
	+ Review parallel calculation, it suffers from races
		+ Also See if can continue queueing tasks without waiting for all blocks of chunks
	+ Bombs:
		+ Spec:
			+ Placed and removed with similar tool as Point Pinning
			+ Two types of bombs: timer and remote controlled
			+ A bomb explodes when:
				+ Its timer times out or the remote control is triggered
				+ The point it's attached to is destroyed 
				+ A point or spring in the "neighborhood" (a separate, small radius) is destroyed (includes nearby explosion)
			+ When one or more bombs are detonated, ship needs to know only position, connected component ID, and blast radius, 
			  not even point index
				+ Thus (exploded) bombs are independent from lifetime of point that they were attached to,
				  allowing ship to destroy point immediately at first step of detonation, for example
				  if we have multiple-step detonations
				+ By not using point index we allow explosions to affect multiple connected components (of same ship though)
			+ Bomb decides for itself when it's to be deleted, and Bombs consequently removes it from
			  collection (and from point indirectly via Bomb::Destroy which, if attached to point, calls Points::Detach)
				 
		+ Impl:
			+ Final test
			+ TEST: bombs are attached to springs instead of points
				+ Move isAttached buffer from Points to Springs
				+ Move mass trick to springs
				+ Bomb position becomes positionA and positionB (bomb attached across)
					+ Also BlastHandler argument is positionA and positionB
					+ Blast calculated's by ship from middle point
				+ inline Springs::GetPointA/BPosition(Points const &)
				+ Points::SetMassToMaterial(float ~offset)
				+ Restructure positionA and positionB:
					+ Freeze position and rotation offset, not positionA and positionB
				+ Fix calculation of alpha - check just zero
			+ TEST: lead-in: continuate ping counter, just different velocity and different translation to frame index
			+ TEST: 360 rotation
			+ Fix mass augmentation
				+ Also update springs' coefficients
			+ Fix blast flipping
			+ TEST: run in debug
			+ FIX: first blast handler is so small that it doesn't find point in radius
				+ Go linearly from 0.6 to BlastRadius
				+ At end, re-enable texture frame for explosions
			+ FIX: ContinuousSound start while paused issue
				+ DesiredState
			+ FIX: TimerBomb x,y offsets
				+ Restore cursor hotspot
				+ Add temporarily fixed world offset at ShipRenderContext
					+ Desired center: 147, 228 off 300, 300 => +3, -78 over 12.0, 12.0 makes 0.12, -3.12
				
			+ Bomb base class, w/type enum
				+ Update(OnBombExplosionStep(position, radius)) -> bool = 0:

					+ Returns false when needs to be deleted
				+ GetRenderFrameIndex() -> size_t
					+ Specialized for state machines
				+ NeighborhoodDisturbed() = 0
					+ Invoked when needs to explode because own or near point is disturbed
			+ Two subclasses - TimerBomb and RCBomb
				+ RCBomb:
					+ RCBomb::Detonate(): input to state machine
					+ Update():
						+ Basics
						+ Explosion
					+ Finalize GetArea(): decide if new enlarged explosion looks good
					+ NeighborhoodDisturbed()
						+ Equivalent to RCDetonate()
				+ TimerBomb:
					+ Update(): state machine
						+ Sparkles: sort frames by distance on fuse and do random choice on sliding window
						+ Add a base frame of bomb with no fuse
							+ Rename all frames
							+ Fix calculation of base frame count at Update()
						+ Smoke:
							+ 3 sequential frames
					+ NeighborhoodDisturbed()
						+ Explodes only if state machine duration < own time left
			+ Bombs class
				+ Not ElementContainer, just manager
				+ cctor takes shared_ptr<IGameEventHandler>, ExplosionHandler, Points &
				+ Update(OnBombExplosion(position, radius)) -> void
					+ Runs through all bombs and invokes ::Update() on each
					+ Removes a bomb if its Update() returns false
						+ Detach it if attached
				+ ToggleTimer/RCBombAt(position) 
					+ same logic as pinned points
					+ returns boolean
				+ DetonateRCBombs()
					+ Calls Detonate() at each RCBomb
				+ Upload(RenderContext)
					+ Always upload all bombs, each w/current render frame index
				+ OnPointDestroyed(idx)
					+ For each bomb:
						+ If bomb is attached to this point:
							+ Detach bomb from point
						+ If bomb within (new, smaller) radius from point:
							+ Call bomb->NeighborhoodDisturbed()
				+ OnSpringDestroyed(idx)
					+ Bombs also takes Springs
					+ For each bomb:
						+ If bomb within radius (new GameParameters parameter, smaller) from spring mid-point:
							+ Call bomb->NeighborhoodDisturbed()

			+ Points also has bool HasBombAttached buffer for interactions & lookups, just like pinned points 
				+ Also changes mass (just at point, for gravity only...)				
				+ Flag and mass change is done at Points::AttachBomb()/Points::DetachBomb() 

			+ Events:
				+ OnRCBombPlaced/Removed(size, underwater): used by MainFrame to enable/disable detonation menu item
					+ Also invoked when explodes
				+ OnTimerBombPlaced/Removed(size, underwater): used by SoundController to start/stop and set volume
				  of timer bomb sound
					+ Also invoked when explodes
				+ OnBombDetonated(size): used by SoundController 
				+ OnRCBombPing(size): used by SoundController 

			+ Ship implements:
				+ ToggleTimer/RCBombAt(position)
					+ FW to Bombs
				+ DetonateRCBombs()
					+ FW to Bombs
				+ @Update(): invokes Bombs::Update() w/handler
					+ After spring stress check, so explosion is visible before it breaks things up
				+ @Render(): invokes Bombs::Upload(RenderContext)				
				+ Ship::PointDestroyHandler: 
					+ Bombs::OnPointDestroyed(idx)
				+ Ship::SpringDestroyHandler: 
					+ Bombs::OnSpringDestroyed(idx)

					+ For points we fire the event in the ship's PointDestroyHandler; if we

					  + If we do this, we can now also remove firing of break from within Springs::UpdateStrains,

		+ OnDestroy(Material const *, size) // size=1 for each destroy, but Dispatcher aggregates assuming size=anything
		+ OnBreak(Material const *, size) // size=1 for each break, but Dispatcher aggregates assuming size=anything

			+ Registration of real sinks (vector of plain IGameEventHandler *)
			+ Aggregation of duplicate events 
				+ e.g.: OnBreak: keep distinct Material * and sum for size
				+ Clears aggregations at OnStepStart() (from GameController) and publishes them
				  to registered sinks at OnStepEnd()
	+ GameController gives shared_ptr<GameEventDispatcher> to Game at Game's cctor (as shared_ptr<IGameEventHandler>)
	+ GameController calls mGameDispatcher (shared_ptr<GameEventDispatcher>)->OnStepStart()/End()
	+ Invoke events at Game and below (pass handler at XYZ.Update())
	+ First GameEventHandler: EventTicker
		+ It's custom panel at bottom with text ticker

			+ Mapping of sounds with IGameEventHandler events via:

					+ SoundMaterial: enum(wood, metal, ...)
					+ Material enums have StrToX()
				+ Filename patterns of sounds and music (e.g. destroy_wood_small_underwater_1.wav)
					+ Parse: if 'destroy'=>expect SoundMaterial next, then ...
				+ Storage of sounds:

+ Fix: When land is above water, water is upside down

+ Optimization: to improve locality: points in contiguous buffer
	+ No PointerVector but (fixed) std::vector<Point>, and others point to locations in the vector
	+ Points never deleted, just marked
		+ So have to check point.IsDeleted() each time the Point buffer is iterated
		+ No check
	+ Point destroy: also clear *own* references
	+ Try contiguous buffer also with springs and triangles
		+ And not checking isDeleted
			+ Remove assert's
		+ Multi-step create loop
		+ Spring destroy: also clear *own* references
		+ Triangle destroy: also clear *own* references
		+ Do check IsDeleted for Spring and Triangle operations that may affect connected non-deleted points
		+ New perf: 15.7/15.8
		+ See ElementContainer::range(start, end)
			+ UnitTests, verify last excluded
	+ IsDeleted needs only be checked at SpringRender and TriangleRender
	+ Try fast_qrt for vec2f::length()
	+ Test fast_XYZ at vector
		+ fast_inv_sqrt: 15.2/15.3/15.3
		+ 1/sqrt: 15.3/15.3/15.3
		+ Nuke'em if ok
	+ EventTickerPanel is stealing 1.99% even when not shown

+ Render optimization: only upload spring elements, triangle elements when they're dirty (deletion occurred)
	+ Get perf analysis first:
		- Game::Render: 34.90%:     Ship::Render: 31.53% (Incl)	3.05% (Excl)
			- RenderShipEnd: 28.24%	- Ship::RegisterDeletion: sets mAreSprings/TrianglesDirty=true
	+ cctor: true
	+ set to false after uploaded to RenderContext 
	+ Move XRay flag consumption to RenderContext 

+ Now that we have connected components, fix covering of ship pieces:
	+ Draw batches of triangles and springs by component, so that pieces are "covered" nicely
		+ Ship keeps track of # of connected components and of each size
		+ At RenderXYZ(), allocate N buffers for the vertex indices and dispatch each triangle/spring
		  to the correct buffer based off ConnectedComponentID 
			+ ConnectedComponentID passed by caller (spring or triangle) based off the (first) point
			  of the primitive
				+ assert other points have same ID
			+ Note: points themselves are not affected by this; they're still uploaded in their entirety 
			  once per cycle
		+ At RenderXYZEnd(), draw each connected component buffer from last to first
		+ Do for triangles
		+ Do for springs
		+ Each connected component must be drawn together - its springs then its triangles

+ Technical Debt:
	+ Resources: lowercase filenames

		+ CMake
	+ MainFrame::Die(msg of exc)

		  rely on MainFrame calling GameController::LoadDefaultShip() after registration
	+ Change calls to Point::SubtractFromLastPosition() to AddToLastPosition() and use (& implement) unary '-' operator for vectors
	+ Points and Springs and Triangles::Destroy()'s are templated on Point/Spring/Triangle"Being"DeletedHandlers (others than self),
	  & ship passes own methods
		+ OR: even better, as handler never really changes: cctor takes handler at beginning, given by ship,
		  and stores as std::function
		+ Handlers invoked *before* actual deletion
			+ Comment on handlers on connected-to-argument might be deleted
		+ Not re-entrant - can't delete from within
		+ Handling of pinned point deletion is then done here
		+ See if also whole logic of point<->spring<->triangle can be done in handler
			+ If so, don't pass containers at various Destroy()'s
		+ Test
	+ CircularList::Erase unit test: complete verification of returned iterator
	+ Containers::Destroy and GameEventHandler::OnDestroy rearc:
		+ 3 containers are given shared_ptr<GameEventHandler> and ParentWorld & at cctor
		+ The 2 Destroy()'s fire events (after invoking DestroyHandler), unless otherwise specified
		  via DestroyOptions
		+ Ship's DestroyHandlers don't fire events anymore, and Ship::SpringDestroyHandler takes boolean
		  for triangles (translated from Springs::DetroyOptions)
		+ Test assert's with Debug build

+ Ships:
	+ Titanic:
		+ Introduce weak metal
			+ Use it underneath funnels

+ Fix bug: when you reload ship when paused, no clouds & no ship are visible until resumed
	+ World::Initialize():
		+ Calcs connected components for each ship
		+ Builds clouds
		+ Invoked by GameController after pair of world::Reset and world::AddShip()

+ Compare old (released) look with this one, and see if there are changes (in phys, render,...) to take in
	+ Also jellyfish fixed in 1.2.6? NO

+ Release:

	+ Ship::Render: when there are no changes to elements and we keep uploading stressed springs, we don't reset the count
	  in ShipRenderContext::mElementBufferSizes
		+ Fix simply by having Start and End for uploading stressed springs
		+ Done in FB branch
	+ No default args @ vec cctors
		+ Done in FB branch
