	=========================================================================

	+ No redistribute
		+ @ License
	
	+ When tsunami starts you can see edges during the shaking
		+ Also port to Android

	+ Underwater plants
		! If plant above water it should be flat
		! Generalized concept of "underwater currents", via Formulae to ensure consistency in a distributed implementation 
			- Plants bend with the "current"
				- Current is a horizontal sinusoid, fixed frequency, phase continuasly shifting
					- Phase shifts with wind magnitude: |modulo| always greater than 0 though				
				- Height of sinusoid dictates bend angle
			! 1.0 * sin(spatial_velocity * x + time_velocity * t_sim)
				! spatial_velocity, time_velocity from SimulationParameters
				! time_velocity also depends on wind magnitude
		+ Physics:
			+ UnderwaterPlants container
			+ Density parameter for generation
				+ Default: 200 Max: 1000
				+ Detect changes and update population accordingly, from scratch
				+ Use logarithmic probabilities for types
			+ Each plant has:
				+ Position (of bottom)
					+ x: calculated at creation time via random uniform distribution; never changes
					+ y: calculated at creation time and when ocean floor changes
						+ As min y of ocean floor samples around x (so that roots are covered)
						+ Detect changes to coean floor profile and update accordingly (*)
				+ UnderwaterDepth: calculated at Update() time
					+ Lives in separate buffer and uploaded to RenderContext at each frame (when "underwaterDepthDirty")
					+ Main buffer though holds OceanSurface-provided "proxy for fast coords" to quickly sample depth
						+ Might be best to have fast proxies in own buffer (for speed, like we do with points, etc.)
				+ Type
					+ With distribution as progressive powers of 1/2 for each available type
				+ Scale
			+ Floor changes propagate to UnderwaterPlants (for updating positions) (*)
				+ OceanFloor has mIsDirty
					+ Set to true each time y's change (for params or for heightmap update)
					+ Cleared at OceanFloor::UpdateEnd() (via that new mechanism for after-update cleanups)
				+ UnderwaterPlants::Update() checks it (takes OceanFloor const &) and recalcs as appropriate
			+ SizeMultiplier
				+ SimulationParam
				+ Change detection
			+ RenderUpload:
				+ if mArePlantsDirtyForRendering (set at population changes and at ocean floor changes => y)
					+ Upload x, y, scale, whatever proxy for texture coords
					+ mArePlantsDirtyForRendering = false
				+ Upload oceanHeight (unadulterated, i.e. positive up, 0 at 0)
					+ Rename @ UnderwaterPlants and WorldRenderContext
					+ As buffer, and RenderContext duplicates 4-way
				+ Shader: calculate relative depth (via world Y)

		+ Specularity: at texture geometry:
			+ UnderwaterPlants: get boolean
			+ Upload
			+ WorldRenderContext init: duplicate species, flipping H
			+ WorldRenderContext upload: store atlasTileIndex = 2 * species + isSpecular

		+ Fix texture truncation & bleeding
			+ FIX: negative scale
			+ FIX: interpolate coords between bl and tr
			+ FIX: calc'n of rated quad is wrong - width is 2*
			+ FIX: quad height must also take into account rotated width (for when w>h), and thus virtual Y max must also be calculated
			+ FIX: bounding box must take into account rotation; need *diagonals*

		+ static_assert SimParms::MaxWorldEtc for detecting becoming dynamic

		+ Rendering (WorldRenderContext):
			= Set of plant images (mipmapped generic texture)
				- https://www.istockphoto.com/nl/search/2/image-film?phrase=acquatic%20plants%20transparent
				= Try both linear and mipmapped
					+ Linear
					- MipMapped
				+ Return actual count @ GetUnderwaterPlantsSpeciesCount()
			+ cctor: 
				+ Initialize underwater plant VAO
					+ Two VBOs: one more static, the other (underwater depths) really dynamic
						+ Plant vertex buffer is static, and consists of single (scaled) quads per-plant, with texture coords
				+ Initialize underwater plant textures
					+ Set array for texture-specific params, and vertex attribs has index in this array (i.e. plant type)
						+ Based on global context :: linear atlas
			+ Rough test for textures:
				+ VertexAttribs take temp'ly uv coords (0,...,1)
			+ UploadUnderwaterPlantStaticVertexAttributesStart()
				+ mUnderwaterPlantStaticVertexAttributesBuffer.clear()
				+ mIsUnderwaterPlantStaticVertexAttributesBufferDirty=true
				+ Ensure element indices
			+ UploadUnderwaterPlantStaticVertexAttributes
				+ Actual quad is based off 90degree rotation, as bounding box around rotated texture using theo max
				+ PlantSpace coords: 1.0 for height, variable (<>1) for width
				+ TextureWidthInPlantSpace: which part of plant space width is texture width
					+ Redo ShaderToy shader
			+ UploadUnderwaterPlantStaticVertexAttributesEnd
			+ UploadUnderwaterPlantDynamicInstanceAttributes(std::vector const &)	
				+ assert size consistent with mUnderwaterPlantStaticVertexAttributesBuffer
				+ Copy in bounded vector, keeping size max
				+ Copy times 4
				+ Check disassembly
			+ UploadWind:
				+ Takes current (whatever) + basis
				+ Stores also basis and marks it as dirty IFF different
					+ mBasisWindSpeed, mIsBasisWindSpeedDirty
			+ RenderPrepareUnderwaterPlants:
				+ If mIsUnderwaterPlantStaticVertexAttributesBufferDirty:
					+ Upload
					+ mIsUnderwaterPlantStaticVertexAttributesBufferDirty = false
				+ Upload dynamic
			+ RenderDrawUnderwaterPlants:
				+ Rendered behind last ocean layer			
					+ So behind water
				+ Make sure texture unit activated and texture handle is bound (should be the case already for both linear and mipmapped)
			+ Shader:
				+ Params:
					+ Add all to ShaderSets

					+ World/RenderContext::UploadWind: back to just instant speed

					+ World::Upload: section for underwater currents, after Wind::Upload:						
						+ Calculate UnderwaterCurrentTimeVelocity via Formulae
						+ RenderContext::UploadUnderwaterCurrent(spaceVelocity, timeVelocity)
							-> WorldRenderContext::UploadUnderwaterCurrent
								+ Check either: if different than mCurrent, set/do w/dirty

					+ UnderwaterPlants::Update:
						+ Takes Wind
						+ Calc rotation angle if changed, sets mIsXXXDirtyForRendering
					+ UnderwaterPlants::Upload:
						+ if mIsXXXDirtyForRendering:
							+ RenderContext::UploadUnderwaterPlantRotationAngle
								+ > WorldRenderContext::UploadUnderwaterPlantRotationAngle
									+ Check: if different than mCurrent, set/do w/dirty
							+ mIsXXXDirtyForRendering = false

					+ WorldRenderContext::RenderPrepareUnderwaterPlants:
						+ Now takes simulation time
						+ If rotation angle dirty: set
						+ If spaceVelocity dirty: set
						+ If timeVelocity dirty: set
						+ Set Simulation Time

					+ WorldRenderContext::UploadEnd
						+ Reset flags
				+ Shader on ShaderToy:
					+ Basis
					+ Test little high-frequency ripples
						+ x
						X y
					+ Shader flattens plant (augmenting rotation ramp-up) based on underwaterDepth
						+ Calc pretend yWorld based on fragCoords
						+ Draw line at y=0
						+ Calc depth based on mouse.y
						X Re-try flattening after fixing texture w/more border

					+ Make actual formula for wind speed
						- 0 => PI/2 * 0.05?
						- 20 => PI/2 * 0.25
						- 100 => PI/2 * 0.5?
						- PI/2 * (0.05 + windSpeed * 0.45 / 100) ?
						+ Test whole range:
							- 0 
							- 20
							- 100
					
					+ Personality seed (per-plant)
						+ Used @ rotation, as simple additional phase

					+ Test other images

				+ Shader in FS
					+ Redo vertex attribs
					+ Copy code from shadertoy

		+ Sort by X for perf
			+ Change Populate():
				+ Populate only plants
					+ Calculate bottom Y using helper
					+ Calculate scales using helper
				+ Sort plans
				+ Loop over plants:
					+ Calculate proxy
					+ Make room for ocean depths
				+ Done
		
		+ Lower depth darkening
				
		+ Finalize images
			+ Corals
			+ Buy
				+ Backup
			+ Make 256
				+ Large transparent side border
				+ 0, 1
				+ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
			+ Adjust atlas tile array @ shader

		+ Patches
			+ Cctor: decide # (4-8) and locii (in vector<float>)
			+ Populate:
				+ Go through locii via mod
					+ Clamp to world, modding back when outside
				+ Later: see if we need to leave the last 10% for uniform placing
			+ f[n] = Z - (1 - a)^n * Z
				- With: f[0] = 0; f[n] = f[n-1] + a * (Z - f[n-1])
				- f[n] is the sum of all consumed elements at the beginning of step N
				- invert Y = Z - (1 - a)^n Z as a function of n, Z, and Y
				- a = 1 - (1 - Y/Z)^(1/n)
				- W (constraint: # left) = Z - Y => Y = Z - W
				- a = 1 - (W/Z)^(1/n)
			+ Test: # plants < # patches

		+ SettingsDialog
			+ SettingsManager
			+ Density
			+ SizeMultiplier		

		+ Tests:
			+ Wind on Rain (we've touched that)
			+ Density changes
			+ Ocean floor changes do propagate: (also verify we upload here and only here, via existing logs)
				+ Manual (tool)
				+ Profile
				+ Bumpiness 
				+ Ocean depth
			+ OceanSurface is sampled
			+ Perf impact on Rendering
				+ Save main as "prev" first
				+ Try mipmapped -- SHOULD IMPROVE!
					+ Save current (linear) as "prev"
					+ Test:
						+ Look'n'feel
						+ Perf:
							+ Zoom 0.04, SizeMultiplier & density max:
								- Linear: 12.6-12.9 (avg: 12.8)
								- MipMapped: 12.6-12.9 (avg: 12.7)

		+ Shader finalization:
			+ EffectiveAmbientLight
			+ LampTool
			+ OceanDarkeningRate
				+ Copy from Fishes
			+ Personality
			+ Retry flattening
				+ Do proper wind direction
					+ Requires shader parameter and member, which gets set dirty @ existing UploadWind, and is reset and UploadEnd
					+ Use in shader
				+ FIX: bottom (roots) should not rotate - or else "roots" show up
					+ No rotation at roots
				+ Cleanup commented-out code
			X Try perf impact with packing uniforms in vec's
				+ Copy current to "prev" first
				X Zoom 0.04, SizeMultiplier & density max:
					+ Before: 12.6-12.9 (avg: 12.7)
					+ After: same
			+ Make textures' bottoms narrow, and centered

		+ Remove all logs
			+ WorldRenderContext.cpp
			+ UnderwaterPlants.cpp

		+ Test on old Dell
			+ Rendering impact (test against density 0)
				+ Old: zoom 0.04: rnd=11.0-11.6
				+ New: zoom 0.04: rnd=16			
			+ Static vertex reloads (by playing with density changes)
			X See if bad perf due to dynamic uploads (comment-out for test)
			+ Lower on low-gfx-score computers
				+ Re-test on old Dell
				+ Re-test on new Dell

		+ FIX: rectangle patch (again...) with plant 6
			X Option 1: all powers of two
				- Check first how we build the atlas
				- Port to Android - write it there!
			+ Check Atlas itself and see what could be falling there
				+ Need helper to save image: Render/ImageFileTools.h/cpp
				+ Check individual mipmaps
				+ Count pixels
			! Theo values:
				- Atlas: 4096x2048
				- MipMap 3 H=256 = 1/8
				+ Species 6 in-atlas size: 256x256
				- Species 6 LB corner in MipMap 3: 192, 191 (paint) => 192, 64 (bottom origin)
				+ Species 6 LB corner in Atlas: 1536, 512 (bottom origin) => 1536, 1535 (paint)
				- Species 6 LB corner in Atlas space: 0.375, 0.25
				- Species 6 RB corner in Atlas space: 0.4375, 0.375
				- Species 6 in-atlas size in Atlas space: 0.0625, 0.125
				- Species 6 size in Atlas space: 0.0625, 0.125
				- Dx: 0.0001220703125, 0.000244140625
				- Species 6 LB corner in Atlas space, incl. dx: 0.3751220703125, 0.250244140625
					- {x=0.379760742 y=0.250244141 }
				- Species 6 RB corner in Atlas space, incl. dx: 0.4373779296875, 0.374755859375
					- {x=0.432739258 y=0.374755859 }
			+ Confirmed that theoretical y (==actual y) yields artifact
				! Hence, theory seems wrong...but it's not!
			+ Try clamp in shader
			~ Option 2: alpha cut in shader at <= 0.0 and >= 1.0
				+ Replaces clamp
			X Option 3: try nearest filters
			+ Option 4: 1-px border below (if needed)
				+ Comment-out mask in shader
				X Do on plant 2 to verify: 1 pixel
				+ Do on plant 2 to verify: 2 pixels
				- Do on all other plants
				- Add comment in database
				- Redo all textures
			+ Option 5: back to linear
			+ When done:
				+ Cleanup shader
				+ Cleanup code

		+ Merge into master

		+ Changelist

		+ Move this work item to Done

	+ Send beta
	+ Bump up version

	+ Higher-definition world textures (from Android work)

	+ ShipBuilder: Texture alignment optimizer
		+ Do
			+ FIX: top/bottom wastes @ TextureTest2 should be equal
				! Right waste: tx=300 => sx=100, tCenter=301.5, waste=1.5 x9 => 13.5
			+ See if constraining search to half a ship quad yields comparable results
		+ Verify waste in Model import matches optimal
		+ Add checkbox for it at Preferences (default ON)
			+ Workbench state
			+ UI
			+ Use @ TextureLoad
			+ Test OK/Cancel
		+ See if larger search radius reduces waste on that ship

				+ H
				+ V
		+ Remove logs
		+ Mark item @ Android/Ships
		+ Model validation checks: texture size
			+ Move MaxTextureSize to WorkBench

	+ ShipBuilder: Texture Translate Tool
		+ Icon

		+ Tool
			+ Templated on layer type
			+ Copy from StructuralRectangleTool
			+ MouseDown starts, MouseUp finalizes
				+ Start: take full copy of layer (TextureLayerData, using ModelController::CloneXXXLayer), in engagement data
				+ Move: 
					+ Blit that to ModelController
						+ Create new empty (transp) texture
						+ Blit into it
					+ Make undo (first time only)
			+ SHIFT lock
			! No limits
		+ Test:

	- Fix SoundController::OnBombExplosion: it's using max() when it should be using min()

	- DoDisplaceWater setting should also control Fishes and NPCs
		- ...find if anything else displaces water without checking toggle

	- Lightning tool, like in Android

	- See perf impact with double the world


	- Try Android font

	- Fishes on wreck (see paper in Malta book)

	- Ocean rendering:
		- Check if the 20ms for upload we see on Dell when ocean high detail is enabled, are due to uploading cloud shadows asynchronously
			- Test: buffer cloud shadows into a member, and then upload at on-render-thread upload
		- See how it would look if cloud shadows at night would be visible via moonlight
			- If goes through: port to Android
	- Ocean render optimizations:
		+ Baseline: 5.60-5.67-5.80 @ camy~-100
		X Try perf rendering: ocean vertex buffer padding to be aligned
			+ 5.60-5.68
		- Slow rendering: could be due to ocean texture not being mipmapped (bandwidth to transfer texture)
			- See what LOD is used at default zoom, I'm afraid it's 1
		- Halve Perlin noise size

	- Try optimization in CollisionOnOceanFloor:
		- Vectorize calculation of height field Y:
			- Loop 4 points (followed by single loop)
				- Do prefix calculations, accumulating into vec4
				- Calculate delta y at once
				- Loop on the four
		- If OK: port to Android

		- Happens with the FS Birthday ship

	- Reduce ghost forces from depth pressure
		- See https://discord.com/channels/925233659118755842/1313073164879921203/1313073164879921203

	- Look at non-anti-aliased borders
		! On my new dell, also 1.18 shows non-anti-aliased borders - so it's a problem with my box

	= See if fire may emit Heavy smoke
		! Gist:
			! Smoke shuld be drawn behind flames => "Z Issue"
				- TODO: write solution here, which includes preliminary PlaneId rearc so that triangle ("main") planes start from 1 and everything in the background
				  is on plane PlaneId-1
					- This should remove necessity of separate flame uploads and of its layer (iff that layer is only for it)
					- Test with code first if this solution flies with TODOOLD below
						- We _do_ early discard at generic textures after all, but that might not be enough
				- TODOOLD was:
					- Smoke should be drawn behind flames, hence GenericTexture's should be in an earlier layer than flames.
					  However, generic textures (smoke) have internal transparency, while flames have none; the Z test makes it so then
					  that smoke at plane ID P shows the ship behind it, even though there are flames at plane IDs < P (which should have been shown instead)
					  - TODO: is this ameliorated by the early pixel discard? Do test mentioned above
			! New ad-hoc dark smoke texture
			! New shader with growing effect similar to clouds shader
				! Or leveraging darker areas: instead of becoming transparent, threshold towrads dark grows and cuts off rest
				! Need a new shader anyway, 'cause black smoke looks awful when it fades away
				! Texture coords are params (set @ initialization, texture never changes)
				! Also random rotation angle
			! See if can replace timer bomb's fuse "heavy smoke" eph particle textures
				! These use room in Generic textures!
		- Impl:
			- 1. Do test above: see if planes and Z are enough, if all shaders do early discard
			- 2. If test ok, finalize work with plane-1
				- Replace Flames' dual upload
		- Also, new fire emitter for black smore
			- See if this item was somewhere else in the plan
		- Also TimerBomb's wet fuse should do same smoke (current one is ugly)

	- New materials (*)

	- Watertight doors should stay put even after unpowered (or new type altogether)

	- AntiGravity TODOHERE: bomb or tool?
		+ Make branch: anti_gravity_field
		- First, test feasibility
			+ Fixed min mass (so light materials have more force, thus move more and break)
			- Try with mass imbalance; possible funcs f(m):
				- f: 0 at 0, growing slowly with m => then mass = mass - f(m)
			- Try with segment
		- If ok:
			- Line shader:
				- Progress with chaotic noise
	
	- Test: underwater forces based on waves (derivative @ surface plus damper for depth)
		- Just test feasibility
		- If ok, optimize using cached depth?

	- Ship in mud
		- 1. Impact
			- "My idea could be using the sea bed as a sort of cushion and quick sand effect, I'm thinking that the sea floor can have a softer silt Simulation. 
			   It seems like the silt doesn't allow any give even at the softest setting and it still hitting the ground like a wall."
			- Also: floor deforming upon impact
				+ Note: we already have OceanFloor::DisplaceAt; read below
			- Render:
				- Dust clouds
					- Could be short-lived ephemeral particles driving rendering of a texture, much like smoke
						- Springing up from impact, then quickly falling down (very heavy)
		- 2. Silting
			- Once on the floor, should dive more than today
			- Render:
				- Ideally the ship shows through the floor, with a random pattern 
					- think: Perlin controlling alphaing of floor over ship
		- Possible 1:
			- OceanFloorDatabase: replaces flat list of textures with declaration of textures + physical properties (i.e. hardness)
				- Move ocean floor textures into own folder, referenced by database implementation
				- We still verify at runtime that folder content is covered
			- Physics:
				- Velocity @ impact time determines reponse (both P and V), via function that careully modulates input V to do:
					- Right penetration and impact response
					- Right generation of dust clouds
			- Rendering:
				- Dust clouds:
					- Eph particles
					- Shader does radial expansion (or Perlin-based like clouds)
						- Speed depends on V of particles
					- Lifetime:
						- TODO: based on dust settling down?
					- Alpha based on lifetime
						- So clouds continue on floor
				- Floor transparency:
					- TODO: how can we avoid having to work on floor shader? Z depth tricks?

		- WAS:
			= Ocean floor deforming upon impact (*)
				! Better done after frontier work, so that may calculate pointness
				+ ParentWorld exposes DisplaceOceanFloor(x, offsetY)
				- @ Ocean floor collision: upon (non-orphaned) point entering floor:
					- Ocean floor's H goes back (opposite) by displacement * FloorFriability * f(pointness, massiveness)
						- displacement is whatever displacement we moved (bounced) the point by
						- FloorFriability = new param [0.0, ..., 1.0]
						- pointness = TBD, based off frontier
						- massiveness = point's connected component size
				- WATCH OUT: might be ugly with peaks (very vertical slope)
					- Increase resolution of ocean floor - shouldn't impact perf other than for cache misses
					- Another way to reduce the warping is to have varying resolution, btw - e.g. the ocean floor becoming more detailed where an impact happens
						- That could also open up to simulating a layer of sand that gets disturbed with the impact, without having to use particles, but by just playing with that higher-resolution "bitmap"
				- Could also have a "dust cloud" effect


	- New SplashScreenDialog:
		- Upper part OpenGL, lower part progress bar
			- Own OpenGLContext (a third one) on own thread
		- Dialog has own timer, updating animation in OpenGL quadrant as follows:
			- 0: OpenGL quadrant occupies whole dialog
			- 1. G2-Labs Sequence
			- 2. Fade to black
			- 3. OpenGL quadrant gets resized to allow for progress bar underneath
				- Or OpenGL quadrant stays, and dialog becomes taller downwards for progress bar quadrant
			- 4. Progress bar shows progress, and OpenGL quadrant shows ship sinking, stepping with progress
		- OnProgress is always called, but has a visible effect only from step 3 onwards

	- A way to spawn ships like NPCs: at any place

	- Add more music:
		- Background:
			+ "Symmetry" - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)			
			+ https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/intervention/
				! 'Intervention' by Scott Buckley - released under CC-BY 4.0. www.scottbuckley.com.au

		- Buy new track for farewell: https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/204959560-nearer-my-god-thee

	- Consider invoking World::Upload from render thread (via RenderContext, as func<>, *synchronously*)
		- So that may upload to GPU buffers directly (or at XYZEnd()), instead of local temp buffers
			- Eventually using mapped buffers, so no local storage at all, unless when mapped buffers not possible because we don't know size in advance or e.g. need sorting
		- Plan:
			! Measure perf in all below
				- Ideally on old Dell
			- 1a. Quick'n'dirty test A
				- Just invoke World::Upload from thread, no other changes needed other than not calling RenderThread for those few uploads that happen on render thread
			- 1b. Converge to optimum
				- Replace, one by one, local buffers with mapped buffers / upload at end() (when mapped buffers not possible)
					- Nuke corresponding RenderPrepare() each time


	- Try to lower global damping - seems quite slow

	- Ship passwords only to prevent being edited, but allow password-protected ships to be inspected

	- ShipStrengthRandomizer: try to optimize
		- Responsible for half of loading time

	- Render glowing particles after burning
		- Ship points rendering: temperature attribute should be enough for new code in shader
			- TODOOLD: swap rot with temperature?
			- Do we still see browned particles?

	- Redo timer bomb
		- Shader for fuse + sparks

	- Try with parallel "water" subsystem, but for "bulk" (gravel, etc.)
		- May co-exist with water
		- Physics slightly different (more dense)
		- Placed via "Hopper" tool, w/submenu for different materials
			- From materials DB, but hidden from builder
			- OR: just single material, for simplicity?
		- Physics impl:
			- Same subsystem as water (now renamed "Internal Fluids"), own buffers
			- UpdateWaterMomenta: double calculations in existing loops
				- Only difference: horizontal propagation is subject to "friction"

	- Option to have larger world size

	- New tool: Punch (was: wrecking ball tool)
		- Spec:
			- Like ocean floor collision, against a sphere (which only grows quickly at initial engagement)
			- OLD: Works only on frontier from outside->in
				- Might want to try, at end, also from inside->out
				- TODO-WHY OLD: because doing like ocean floor collisions is essentially the same, except that it also works on ropes
		- Impl:
			- TODOHERE

	- Replace points with quads from geometry shader

	- Adjustable level of water
		- Think of problem with flattening waves on bottom?

	- Transparency setting for glass material
		- Managed by Ship adjusting colors' alpha's

	- Frozen structure (*)

	- Bubbles issue (that "old" issue)
		- Add temp code to calc total internal water, and see if it's true that it keeps increasing
		- Do same for "other internal pressure"

	- Fireworks (*)

	- Review rope strength:
		- 0.025 is better, but stresses too much
			- Add optional stress_strength_fraction material property, default=current value, for ropes=100%

	- Make Mac instructions
		- SFML build: https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/1496

	- Misc quick things:
		- See if water entering via hole is faster than water entering natural non-hull ("cut funnel")
			- See why Bernoulli doesn't make inflow faster
		- Negative pressure in Mylar bubble - bug?
		- See why with high water density, water entering a ship goes above the waterline - bug?

	- Lights improvement options (*)

	- Sources of Light
		- See if there's a * below
		- Add to fireworks as precondition
		- Spec:
			- Ship owns LightSource instance, just container of point index, material params, calcd params
				- A part of it is fixed, the other comes and goes
					- ElectricalElements go to fixed part
					- All others to dynamic part
				- Buffer-aligned
				- Params are shader-friendly, as we'll upload them with Lights Improvements work (*)
			- Add/Removed to by:
				- ElectricalElements: added @ init & kept forever
					- Populated initially by ship invoking ElectricalElements::PopulateLightSources(LightSource &)
					- LightSource::AddStaticSource -> LightSourceIndex
					- Lamp state @ ElectricalElements stores the index in LightSource, which is needed for setting params, etc.
				- Firework state machine: added & removed as needed
					- LightSource::Add/RemoveDynamicSource
					- Ephemeral particle state @ Point stores the index in LightSource, which is needed for setting params, removing, etc.
			- Used by lighting algorithm AND by shader (after Lights Improvements work (*))

	- Sound space (*)

	- ShipRenderContext: see if may turn off Z-depth check @ triangles
		- Check first on Dell if doing so would improve perf

	- See if may put smoke emitters behind triangles and springs
		- At the moment we're using GenericTextures for smoke, hence we're in the same layer as bombs, etc.;
		  need to have a way to change layer, which would however require a different rendering batch (because
		  of different orthomatrix)

	- Test: re-try cache layout optimizations
		- See current optimization's impact first with NOP optimization
		- Check if simply ordering points by X makes it faster (because of improved ocean floor/ocean surface sampling locality)

	- Splashes
		- Option A) Ephemeral particles with own shader:
			- Texture of splash
			- Elongated with vertical velocity
		- Option B) Same as A, but instead of one single texture, a (small) set of frames
		- Option C) Fully "movie" (not ephemeral particles), just like explosions

	= Full high-DPI path:
		! a) Window scaling: on a 2X DPI, a wxWindow of size (500, 500) would be (1000, 1000) on Mac and (500, 500) on Windows. To overcome this, use wxFrame->FromDIP:
			  myFrame->SetClientSize(wxSize(400, 300));   -->   myFrame->SetClientSize(myFrame->FromDIP(wxSize(400, 300)));
		! b) Physical pixels are never scaled, on any platform, and must be used when drawing graphics elements to ensure that the best possible resolution is used. 
		     For example, all operations on wxGLCanvas use physical pixels. To convert between logical and physical pixels, you can use wxWindow::GetContentScaleFactor(): 
		     this is a value greater than or equal to 1, so a value in logical pixels needs to be multiplied by it in order to obtain the value in physical pixels.
		+ Tests:
			+ With plist (i.e. full screen): ContentScaleFactor=1 DPIScaleFactor=1 100x100dip=100x100px
			+ Without plist (i.e. 1/4th of screen): ContentScaleFactor=2 DPIScaleFactor=2 100x100dip=100x100px
			+ See mouse coords: are they scaled or not scaled?
				! Max is 1900, i.e. scaled
				+ Remove TODOTEST @ MainFrame.cpp
		+ Changes:
			+ _PixelCoordinates and _PixelSize ("logical" and "physical" versions via usings & tag template param)
				+ @ GameTypes, "Rendering" section
			+ GameController::cctor / IGameController: all interface methods take/return coords of correct type (i.e. always the "window" ("logical") type)
			+ RenderContext / ... / ViewModel: all methods take/return coords of correct type
			+ RenderDeviceParameters: takes LogicalToPhysicalPixelFactor, passed down to ViewModel
			+ ViewModel:
				+ Stores LogicalToPhysicalPixelFactor for returning (and taking) "logical" types
				+ Precalcs canvas width/height as "physical"
			+ ToolController: mouse position in MouseState is in LogicalPixelCoordinates
			+ Tools
				+ _PixelXXX::From/ToFloat
			+ MainFrame: pass ContentScaleFactor to RenderDeviceParameters
			+ Tests:
				+ Pan & increment from settings
				+ Tools:
					+ Rotation
					+ MoveBy
				+ Shaders: cross of light, interactive, texture notifications
				+ Screenshot

- Suggestions to spec:

	- Sails system: new layer with sails, so they can be on top of structure
		- Or: one sets *nodes* in new layer, and a sail is spawn

	- Material: gravity shield
	- Explosions improvements:
		- (Kiko) For explosions, i think the "blast wave" could follow along the decks instead of spreading out in a circle
			- Escape via holes
				- Note that the above is about external vs. internal explosions
				- Explosive particles that come with the ship cause internal explosions, while bombs placed by the player cause external explosions
			- Also damage structure
				- Ideally by bending only
		- And for explosive materials, instead of each particle exploding individually, i think they should combine and form a single larger explosion
	- Choice for flames: inside vs outside
		- Inside won't extinguish with water
		- Inside could damage the structure but not the hull
	- Northern lights
	- Heat bomb
		- Just heat
	- Fishing log
		- Players can collect different kinds of fish; click on one they don't have and it goes into like a collectors book
		- Could have a "fishing rod" tool
	- Drain ocean
	- Shockwave bomb
		- When detonated the area destroyed is quite small but it sends out a shock wave with a pretty big radius that can cause things to break or collapse and stuff like that. Also maybe it could be very damaging to rotted materials, causing it to shatter like the thanos snap thing.
	- Make lights not propagate through hull
	- Sun rays
	- Moving furniture
		- Need way to prevent springs made to other materials
	- Slow motion
		- When bombs explode
	- Wreno's suggestions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kOYAgvh2rFYJJBnSp4DCiFm3FdJlfVEiCXQWNzJzO-I/edit
	- Be able to place nuke and AM bomb anywhere
	- Different colored lights
	- Different maps: maps that might even have islands and grass
	- Black hole
	- Tool to increase or lower mass under the cursor
	- Can the bubble tool be used to remove water from the ship? that could be pretty cool
	- I wonder if that's possible to make the UI dark once the brightness of the game gets lower than a specific level just like your make the FPS counter white
		+ Tools turning white at night
	- Tornado
		- Mixes swirl and grab
	- Meteorites
	- Earthquake
	- Add circular zones around bombs when placing showing what the expected blast radius should be. The circle should change in size when settings are tweaked. Much better than crunching numbers to figure out what's gonna happen.
	- Air friction: e.g. you throw a ball and it catches fire

	- Update Idea: When we get collision detection AND the ability to spawn multiple ships can you make a "Magnet" colour for eletrical ships, where you can push a switch and it activates a magnet, and if two ships have close magnets, they connected? that would be amazing! We could have aircraft carriers acutally carry helicopters/planes, and tugboats rescuing ships!

		-3 bodies of water:
			- sea water: the default
			- lake water: a brownish color; not as good as decaying ships, they turn brown but don't break apart
			- river water: a constant turbulent water that flows along the contour of the terrain much like a river does
			- more details:
				So I know you said different water types would be something in the distant future
				but I was thinking about something unique that could involve lake water
				the rot is minimal so I was thinking of an alternative growth
				was thinking that maybe we could have zebra mussel colonies that grow on the wrecks over time in fresh water
				we could introduce a new tool
				like a picaxe type tool that can remove heavy growths like zebra mussels and barnacles
				barnacles would be the problem for the default water settings
				and zebra mussels could be something in lake water settings
				these would slowly colonize the hull and put weight on it			

	- Nuclear bomb (from Denis Nesterenco):
		Nuclear Bomb Idea for Floating Sandbox
		1. Main Effects of a Nuclear Explosion
		A nuclear explosion in the game should include several key elements:
		* Massive blast wave – instantly shatters the ship into pieces, creating a giant shockwave on the water.
		* Fireball – the center of the explosion reaches temperatures high enough to melt and vaporize metal.
		* Powerful pressure surge – ships are torn apart, with debris flying in all directions.
		* Gigantic tsunami – if the bomb detonates in water, it creates a huge wave that sweeps everything away.
		* Radiation contamination – any objects within the affected zone slowly deteriorate due to radiation.
		2. Stages of a Nuclear Explosion
		2a. Flash and Thermal Radiation
		A blinding flash instantly illuminates the entire screen.
		Everything at the epicenter ignites or vaporizes instantly.
		Metal becomes white-hot, while wooden parts burst into flames.
		2b. Shockwave
		A fraction of a second after the flash, a powerful blast wave follows.
		The ship is torn apart – the closer it is to the epicenter, the greater the damage.
		Water is pushed away from the explosion, forming a crater on the surface.
		3. Mushroom Cloud and Radiation
		After the explosion, a massive mushroom cloud rises above the detonation site.
		Radioactive fallout gradually descends onto the water, causing long-term destruction.
		4. Interaction with Water
		If the explosion occurs underwater, a giant water dome forms, followed by a powerful tsunami.
		Ships farther away might not break apart immediately, but they could capsize due to the wave.
		If a ship is on the surface, the force of the explosion could push it sideways or submerge it due to water pressure.
		5. Player Tools
		* Power selection – from "tactical charge" to "megaton bomb."
		* Destruction radius customization – create a compact explosion or wipe out the entire map.
		* Different explosion types – airburst (shockwave), underwater detonation (tsunami), contact explosion (instant vaporization).
		* Slow-motion mode – observe destruction in cinematic slow-motion.
		How Would It Look in the Game?
		Imagine: you drop the bomb, and within a second, the screen is engulfed in a blinding flash. The ship begins to melt, and in an instant, a massive blast wave obliterates everything into splinters. The water boils, debris flies in all directions, and then... silence—only broken by a colossal tsunami surging towards the remnants.

	- 1. bombs
		Types:
		* Conventional bomb - falls downward on a ballistic trajectory, explodes on contact with the ship or water.
		* Fusion bomb - creates a powerful blast wave, tearing through the ship's hull.
		* Concrete bomb - punctures several decks before detonating.
		* Nuclear Bomb - the most powerful explosion with heat radiation, shockwave, tsunami, and radiation.
		Mechanics:
		The player chooses a drop location.
		The bomb falls, taking into account air resistance and gravity.
		The impact creates a funnel of damage, holes in the hull, and possible fire.

	- 2. Rockets
		Types:
		* Winged missile - flies low over the water, strikes the target with a powerful explosion.
		* Ballistic Missile - Launches in an arc, pierces the ship from above.
		* Hypersonic Missile - incredible speed, almost impossible to shoot down.
		* Nuclear Missile - creates an explosion of colossal force, possibly even destroying the entire map.
		Mechanics:
		The player selects a target, the missile flies to it automatically.
		It is possible to control the missile in flight.
		On impact - a powerful explosion, holes, flying debris.
		flying debris.

	- 3. Mines
		Types:
		* Contact mine - detonates when touched by a ship.
		* Non-contact mine - detonates when the target approaches, creating an underwater explosion.
		* Nuclear Mine - rare type, can destroy an entire fleet.
		Mechanics:
		The player places mines in the water.
		Ships may accidentally bump into them.
		The underwater explosion creates a hull rupture and a hurricane wave.
		and a shockwave.

	- 4. torpedoes
		Types:
		* Conventional torpedo - travels directly to target, explodes on contact.
		* Homing torpedo - corrects course, finds ship automatically.
		* Supercavitation torpedo - moves very fast, pierces hull through.
		* Nuclear Torpedo - powerful underwater explosion with a huge tsunami.
		Mechanics:
		Launched from a submarine or ship.
		The torpedo moves in the water, given resistance.
		When detonated, it pierces the hull, creating flooding.

	- Additional mechanics
		* Fuel and Ammunition - hitting an ammunition depot amplifies the explosion.
		* Fire and smoke effects - fires, detonation, fire flashes.
		* Depth charges - special bombs to destroy submarines.

	- See if may upgrade SFML to master (~2.6) with OPUS support
		- Then make all music OPUS
	- Looped sounds (engines, bells, horns, etc.): make them OGG with built-in loop points (see https://rpgmaker.net/tutorials/1341/)
	- Redo SetEventRecorder dynamics between GameController/World/Ship
		- Also GameController::Reset() should clear all events
	- To further improve parallelism at Ship::Update, could allow threads to publish events by having EventDispatcher allow multiple threads to store* event
		- No locks needed on read and clean, as it's done after Update has finished
	- Fix: RenderContext destructor unbinds and then deletes all, causing OpenGL calls with no current context
		- Need to unbind using finalizer, as first member of RenderContext (thus last dctor called)


- Known issues (bugs):
	- After many many hours, rain looks aweful - very likely due to timer values being high
		- Storm: store timestamp of rain start, and pass (now-start)::to_float() to shader
	- After many hours, zoom stutters
		- Can test both with faking RealTimeClock start time?
		- Solutions for long-running clock: https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/dont-store-that-in-a-float/
			- Rain solution: 
			- Zoom solution: ParameterSmoother: various timestamp members become time_point (rather than float's)
		- Might have same issue with various tools
		- TODO: is it really worth fixing this?
	- FIX: background flames carry backdrop with them
		! Was like this also before
		! Because background flames are drawn *before* triangles, hence Z depth makes them carry sky
			! They are drawn *before* triangles because ropes *are* before triangles (order is: rope, BG flame, triangle)

	- Investigate Gauss-Seidel from SpringLab
		- It has better stiffness (bending large model: 180 vs. 108)

		- Points: Position with Velocity and Force
			- Affects Integrate and Rendering

	- UpdateWaterDynamics:
		- Test turning it around into (multiple) spring visits, rather than point visits
			- Multiple because of need to normalize outgoing for each point

- Gfx optimizations:

	- Temperature buffer is currently uploaded separately; now that we've made it "mainstream", see if it makes more sense
	  to upload it together with the other frequently-changing fields (i.e. water, light)
		- Pre: UPL=0.05ms

	- OceanFloor doesn't need to be uploaded at each step
		- However, vertex buffers rely on inputs such as view model, so when these change, we'd need to trigger a re-upload from OceanFloor itself
		- So, best solution would be to make VertexBuffer independent from these extra parameters

	- Reduce number of VAO changes by incorporating multiple VBOs into one, with element size as large as largest (union of structs)
		- Each element type though retains its own BoundedVector, which is uploaded as-needed into larger VBO

	- See impact of drawing onto texture and then quad'ing the texture onto the screen (w/no filtering) (*)
		- If fine:
			- Do stars once and for all
			- Spec gfx niceties such as reflections and after-effects/post-processing

	- Lights improvement options (*)
		- "Static light":
			- Pixels that are sources of light should be rendered as constant yellow, without ambient light effect
				- How to do without triangle interpolation?
		- Lights' glows as textures:
			- Shader adapts the texture to the varying light parameters
			- Then a quad is drawn for each source of light, with size depending on aperture
				- TODO: z-depth issue? Lights will be drawn _after_ ship parts
					- Try to just draw textures at their Z, with Z test enabled
					- Need to be drawn *last* as they are transparent
		- Lights on the GPU with instanced drawing
			- Light at fragment (Phong)
				- Lamp coords, spread, and luminiscence in uniform array
			- Loop drawing ship as many times as necessary to avoid going beyond uniform limit of the GPU
				- Figure out max at OpenGLInit
			- Test 1: simply instance TrianglesTexture
			- Test 2: also instance others
			- Test on Dell
		- Check proposed luminiscence settings (from @Carter_JL on GameJolt)
			- Luminiscence Adjust: 0.5
			- Light Spread Adjust: 0.5

	- Air bubbles with instanced drawing (even though we can only do ~100 at a time, but then might do nBubbles/100 vertices)

	- Try using GL_SHORT for Ship texture coordinates
		- Passing NORMALIZE and 3 components to glVertexAttribPointer


- Gfx:

	- Auto-focus improvements:
		- Settings to fine-tune how close (or far) auto-focus should be
			- Basically changes NDC fraction/s

	- Tensile/Stress display: 
		- Show water (@ point buffer)
		- New variant: only color springs (but in "normal" mode)

	- In Windows' "high contrast mode", the names of the ships in the Ship Load Dialog disappear

	- Flames: make sampling resolution independent from dimensions
		- Need to pass width and height of flame quad, and divide texture coords by these

	- Intro screen: the game's title falling into the sea and floating back up - interactive to a smaller extent, e.g.
	  by just punching holes

	- Background ships: just any of the other ships, that would sail in the background

	- Fog
		- Requires post-processing work

	- Different backgrounds: use keys to switch between a dock, cliffs, open ocean, ice field, etc.

	- Sky:
		- Add SkyRenderMode (Flat, Gradient)
			- The two endpoints of gradient dependent on ambient light
				- Interpolated between two pairs of endpoints
			- RenderContext:
				- If Flat:
					- When clearing buffers, clear also color buffer with flat color
				- If Gradient:
					- When clearing buffers, do not clear color buffer
					- Run program with quad immediately afterwards
						- Shader
							- No orthomatrix, all NDC
							- No ambient light param, no new params

			- SettingsDialog:
				- Gradient RadioButton: on the right has two rows with a gradient each
		- Night sky should use a round darkening - center of screen is slightly lighter
			- Or even better, Milky Way

	- Electrical view (*):
		- Spec:
			- New flag (not in ShipRenderMode, standalone ~like StressedSprings)
				- Settable at SettingsDialog
					- Ideally, enabled only if there are electrical elements, but how to figure it out?
			- When enabled, draws "Connections" (lines - using ship endpoints) and "Devices" (points - using ship endpoints)
			  on top of ship
				- One new layer after tri's, springs, and ropes
				- Connection, w/bool isPowered
					- Powered: 1D texture, animated (w/clock->offset), red
					- !Powered: 1D texture, still, grey matte
						- Both textures are segments in same texture
				- Device: shader with concentric expanding and/or contracting circles and different colors
		- Impl:
			- (Ship)RenderContext::UploadElectricalConnection/Device/Start/End:
				- Conn:
					- vec2 startPos, endPos
					- planeId
					- isPowered => texture coord
				- Device:
					- vec2 pos
					- planeId
					- vec4 color => color
			- Ship::Render: if flag set: invokes Ship::RenderElectricalElements()
				- Do a sort of connectivity visit and upload as you go

	= AmbientLightIntensity:
		+ Use also in RenderContext::RenderStart() for clear (sky) color
		+ Phase 1: pgup/down
		= Phase 2: with clock / time-of-day
			- Sky should also have crepuscolar gradient

	+ Add a flashlight to see the ships deep underwater. Its hard to see the ships at some depths. Plus the idea of seeing a rusty hulk of metal appear out of the dark abyss is really cool

	- Less repetitive auto-texturization:
		- Material textures have to become procedurally-generated

			
- Dynamics:

	- Sand particles when hitting ground

	- Material system improvements (*)
		- Descriptions in ShipBuilder palette
			- Materials have optional description ID's (from enum)
			- All strings in LocalizationManager
				- ~"Structure"+"Form/Variant/Kind/Genre/Class"
		- New materials:
			- Structural materials:
				- Soft rubber
					- For joints
				- Gold and copper (from TimCan)
					- Copper would still decay but it would be second slowest to concrete material 
					- Gold would be heavy but unable to corrode like stainless steel
				- Check Longhorn's materials
					- A) New colors for existing materials
					- B) New materials altogether
					- Then these should be taken care of:
						- Uranium 235
							- "A single pixel of uranium when smashed with a hammer or cut with a chainsaw causes a huge explosion the size of the titanic. And it glows blue when you put in underwater."
							- Note: apparently it crashes the game now
				- Invisible material
					- Unlocked only for expert uers?
				- "Lightning rod" material
					- Has precedence when looking for candidates @ Lightning strike
				- Definitely more colors
					- https://discord.com/channels/559822257275404307/561385532698001419/1309941207836786828
					- New metal color (for White Line): F1D4A1
					- "And you can do it differently, leave the existing colors, and to them to make a separate slot, when you click on this slot, the polytra appears, and you choose a color"
				- Bending materials
					- Basically extremely high strength and low spring reduction coeff
				- Redo template!
			- Electrical materials:
			        - Battery: a generator that can power a limited amount of assets for a certain amount of time or uses until it runs out. You can recharge the battery by a lighting or by using the electrical shock tool
				- Backup generators: would activate 10 seconds after connection is cut from the main power and it would power the lights only
					- Has it's own amount of power and will lose the energy over an amount of time but can be revitalized either by gen or with electric shock tool
				- Non-Instanced Watertight Doors (see if possible)
				- Non-Instanced Water In/Out Pumps (see if possible)
				- Clamp
					- A and B types
					- When powered, destroys all springs between each pair of powered A and B points
					- Make ship with lifeboats, using multiple clamps to keep it
				- Flickering lights
					- Lights that flicker forever
				- Logic Gates
					- ...to be worked on...
				- Timer switches (*)
					- materials json
						- Different durations: 1s, 3s, 5s x {ON, OFF}
					+ TimerSwitchState:
						- IsOperating: == is powered
						- opt<end_ts>: when set, we're counting down and reaching target we toggle
					+ Xs Switch ON: 
						- Conductive
						- When powered for the firt time, clock starts ticking; at target: becomes not conductive
						- When powered off, becomes conductive again, and resets timer
					+ Xs Switch OFF:
						- Not conductive
						- When powered for the firt time, clock starts ticking; at target: becomes conductive
						- When powered off, becomes not conductive again, and resets timer
					+ Simple state machine @ UpdateAutomaticConductivityToggles
					+ Reset conductivity each time state is reset
						+ Repair
					- Tests:
						- Repair
					- Gfx: Clock dial (normalized on duration), new ElectricalControl
					- Sound: clock
				- Thermal switch
				- Solar panel
					- Like generator, but only generates power when daylight above threshold, *and* when on frontier
				- Redo template!


	- "Soft" setting for ocean floors
		- Just less impact
		- See also new silting work
	- Sediment on ocean floor
		- Things basically bury a bit
		- Could be adjusted to where players could see through it or not, to show how much is under the mud
		- Sediment could also preserve anything that is buried under it


	- Transfer of momentum from waves to ship
		- When ship surface intersects water surface
		- Option A: by point visit; all points which were not underwater in previous step and are now (via double buffer for Points::CachedDepth), receive force
		  proportional to OceanSurface::VelocityVector
			- OceanSurface::VelocityVector: direction=normal, magnitude=SWE velocity. With two options:
				- A) SWE + Waves (i.e. full samples)
				- B) Just SWE
		- Option B: by point visit; all points in tiny band from depth 0, receive force...same as above....				

	- "Ground" material:
		- Spec:
			- It's just a material which stays in place and has no physical interaction. The idea is to help creating anchoring or any form of support for structures.
			  This will allow people to make bridges or towers, etc... And of course, we could have underground bases anchored to the ground or whatever.
			- Plus, given how you use textures already, perhaps there's a way to apply the ground texture on it as well
			- Could be couple with ship+settings file, to also provide custom terrain

	- Different scale for ships
		+ Metadata now has Scale member to convert ShipSpace into WorldSpace
		- Use at:
			= ShipFactory
			- ShipLoad Preview Window, when displaying size
			- ShipTexturizer::MakeInteriorViewTexture, when calculating floor thickness
			- Spring physics
				- ...to figure out all the places where we assume spring lengths are 1 or sqrt(2)

	- Time slowing down, both automatically (at explosions, at big events, etc.) and by user

	- Spread out spring coeffs' recalculations (*)
		- For better look'n'feel

	- Electric sparks: material-driven
		- New "electrical conductivity" *structural* property - try to name it differently than the electrical property though
			- First off, need "Material Type" rearc (*) just for helping a script that populates electrical conductivity automatically in material json
		- New springs ranking: f(direction + conductivity)

	- Air bubbles with proper vortices, due to water moving fast around it
		- Like at https://youtu.be/KPsnUPIHZuM
		- Kinda as if the originating ship particle's velocity at the moment of generation has a (decaying) impact on the air bubble particle, making it move like an orbit

	- Generalized light emission
		- TODO: obsolete due to "Light Sources" work above
		- Option 1:
			- Points gets struct with:
				- Luminiscence (scalar float) (aka Available Light)
				- Distance coeffs
			- ElectricalElements writes into Points
				- Luminiscence (out of lamp state machine update)
				- Distance coeffs (at game parameter changes)
					- MaterialLightSpread and MaterialLuminiscence are renamed as "Lamp" properties
					- Alternatively: reaction to game parameter changes is at Points, which also stores individual (immutable) particle properties (LightSpread and ~Luminiscence) to be able to recalc calculated
					  values (i.e. distance coeffs) upon param changes, for all particles
						- ElectricalElements::Add(.) "copies" MaterialLightSpread and MaterialLuminiscence immutable particle properties to Points
						- Basically, Points has following:
							- Immutable particle properties + GameParameters -> Calculated particle properties (distance coeffs)
				- TODO: there are two Luminiscence here, rename:
					- Runtime (aka AvailableLight)
					- Material, immutable

			- Points also has fixed-size vector with indices of light-emitting particles
				- Zeroed out at beginning of Update()
				- Added to at each Luminiscence population, i.e. at:
					- ElectricalElements::Update
					- Combustion update
					- Ephemeral update (e.g. of firework sparks)
			- Ship::DiffuseLight populates algo work buffer from Points' vector of indices
		- Option 2:
			- Ship::DiffuseLight populates buffers twice, from:
				- ElectricalElements::Lamps (like now)
				- Points::LightEmittingParticles
					- The latter builds vector of indices at its various Update()'s that contribute to lights, e.g. combustion low freq and/or ephemeral update

	- Fireworks (*)
		- Spec:
			- 2 triggers: toggable thing like bombs, and electrical element that launches when powered
			- State machine of detonated firework owned by ephemeral particles in conjunction with IShipPhysicsHandler
			- 3 initial types:
				- Flair
				- Rose: sparkles radiating immediately from explosion point
				- MultiRose: sparkles radiating with delay from (invisible) sparkles radiating from explostion point
		- Impl:
			- New GadgetType
			- New GameTypes enum: Firework(Kind)Type: Flair, Rose, MultiRose
			- New electrical material: FireworkLauncher X each kind
				- Type: FireworkLauncher
				- Firework(Kind/Type): enum
			- New structural materials:
				- FireworkVector: ~wood
				- FireworkSparkles: ~paper
			+ "Bombs" become "Gadget"
				+ Gadgets::Trigger[RCs,...,FWs]
					+ Visits all IGadgets, and switches on GetType() to invoke specialization-specific Trigger[RC,...,FW]
				+ Event handlers as well
				+ Test all 4 bombs
					+ Place, Remove, Trigger, Explode
			- Points::CreateFirework[Vector|Sparkle]EphemeralParticle:
				- Args:
					- Firework(Kind/Type)
					- Pos, Vel
				- Based on FW type:
					- Alpha, color
				- If needed adds to LightSources
					- ...which is arg to Points::Create...()
			- EphemeralParticle state machine:
				- Vector: on expiry, remove from LightSources 
					- ...which is arg to Points::UpdateEphemeralPoints...()
			- IShipPhysicsHandler:
				- LaunchFirework(fwType, pos, direction)
					- Invoked by: interactive firework detonation, gadget auto-trigger @Gadgets::Update() (e.g. because of temperature), 
					  ElectricalElements::Update (sink)
					- Does: sound, Points::CreateFireworkVectorEphemeralParticle
				- BlastFireworkSparkles(fwType, pos)
					- Invoked by: EphemeralParticle state machine (end of vector)
					- Does: sound, N X Points::CreateFireworkSparkleEphemeralParticle
			- Tool
				- Icon: rocket on tube, out & in
			- Texture + specific shader for Gadget
			- MainFrame & Place/Remove events for menu enabling
			- Sounds
			- ElectricalElements state machine
			- Retrofit a ship
			- GFX (Shaders & Primitives):
				- FireworkVector
					- Params:
						- Vector: direction & magnitude used for quad
						- Scale: world size of square side perpendicular to vector; also side parallel to vector when |vector|==1
							- Used for quad
						- Color: used @ shader
						- [Texture]SpaceCoords: calc'd at quad and used @ shader
						- Halo: 0.0->Halo: hi-brilliant; Halo->1.0: no brilliant going to zero
							- Use narrow SmoothStep for narrow halo transition
							- Used @ shader
				- FireworkSparkle
					-


		- Implementation:
			- Triggers: both options below
			- Once triggered:
				- Rocket flying is one ephemeral particle;
				- Upon expiration invokes IShipPhysicsHandler::ExplodeFirework, which generates new ephemeral particles
			- These various ephemeral particles are also (ephemeral/dynamic) light sources
		- TODOHERE: triggers are both options below
		- Option 1: it's a gadget like bombs
			- "Bombs" become "Gadgets", as well as "IBomb"
			- "Firework" is new gadget
			- Placed by new "Firework" tool, clicking on same rotates through all types + removal
				- Type enum at GameTypes
			- State machine:
				- Ignited by heat (and by water?), and by explicit detonation action
					- Each detonation action triggers one firework detonation, until no more fireworks exist
				- Creates ephemeral particles as needed, and tracks them (remembers their ElementIndex)
				- Also expires ephemeral particles
			- Disadvantage: once fired it's gone?
		- Option 2: it's an electrical material, ignited at 0->1 power transition
			- State machine is started by ElectricalElements::Update via IShipPhysicsHandler
			- State machine takes care of flight and explosion, and of spawning ephemeral particles for sprakles/lights
			- Advantage: same element may keep firing over and over

		- OLD
		- New emitter material, much like smoke emitter
			- Or just new electrical material ?
		- Fires when wet for the first time
			- Or when powered?
		- "Whatever color block it's on it explodes that color" (AwesomeYorkie)

	- Superheated pulverization
		- In small neighborhood of very high threshold - say, 100K degrees, not material-specific - rotting skyrockets

	- Multiple electrical layers:
		- Option 1:
			- Implemented by array of ElectricalElements at Ship
				- Points has also an array of ElectricalElementId, one for each layer
		- Option 2:
			- If ElectricalElements doesn't use springs but own connections, just need Points to have an *array* of electrical elements ID
				- Then ElectricalElements is just flat set of N connected components, one per layer (or more for disconnected circuits in same layer)
				- Think if it would really fly for all features
		- Interaction with Sources of light:
			- If a particle is a source of light on multiple layers at the same time, then the particle will appear in Source of light multiple times
				- Points (ephemeral points): these always implicitly live on layer 0, so on first ElectricalElements
				- Lamps (electrical element): these are by definition per-layer (duh)
		- OLD:
		- Option A: H and V electrical cables
		- Option B:
			- Only the cables should be able to make 8 connections (sides + diagonals)
			- Any devices should only be connected in 4 direction (sides only)
		- Option C: multiple electrical layers

	- Richter reading upon impact (see https://www.quora.com/How-fast-did-the-Titanic-sink-to-the-bottom-and-did-it-make-a-noise-when-it-hit)


	- Gases:
		- Spec:
			- Drawn on separate layer and act as water, but with upside down gravity
			- It will leak through holes
			- Gets destroyed by water
			- Causes air buoyancy
		- Can be implemented as a parallel Point::Water system
			- It will only slow down marginally, and only when the user specifies a gas layer

	- Newton's 3rd law:
		- Emitter materials, like smoke (and a new "jet engine" one), should impart an opposite force on the emitter
		- Jet engine: need a way to render flames/particles coming out

	- Aerodynamic heating https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry, something like friction from the air

	- Air drag is thinner moving up, @ MaxWorldHeight it's open space

	- Lightning tool that summons lightning wherever it has been clicked
		- Lightning pointer: basically instead of lightning at random, you click and lightning strikes where you click

	- When lightning hits (a metal part of) the ship, then lights should go off temporarily

	- Fires break out where electrical layer breaks (e.g. where *powered* line is cut)

	- Tool to break enough to let water enter, but not to make a hole all the way to the other side
		- Just sets points as leaking

	- Randomize decay
		- Perlin noise on ship, created at ShipBuilder, stored as Points::WeakNoise
		- Used as rotting increase
			- From PM: also, idk if you do it already, but it would be fun if the speed of decay was pseudorandomized not by much but just enough so it would cause uneven patterns of decay along the ships
		                   it would simulate defects in the hull or something
				   the only way I have to help visualising what I mean is by adding some noise on top of an image of the ships and the darkness of the colour would represent the rate of decay

	- Underwater currents
		- Option 0: with current underwater plants
			- On frontiers
			- On orphaned points
			- For vortex: try adding small force perpendicular to direction
		- Option 1:
			- New piecewise line across ocean:
				- Divide the ocean width in N chunks (N ~=256)
				- Each chunk boundary gets a point that moves slowly, randomly, and sinuisodally up and down
				- Each imaginary line connecting two adjacent points is the line along which bodies feel most force; the further from the line, the least
					- The gradient from the line should be enough to impart a rotational force to bodies close to the line
		- Option 2 (older):
			- Implicit function of x defines trajectory
				- To try:
					- Constant
					- Lorenz, from http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/chaos/eulermap.htm
					- Lorenz II, from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_96_model
					- OceanSurface profile, but x-shifted
			- For each point: y-distance between point.y and trajectory(point.x) gives strength of x and y components of a force on the point
			- Dynamics:
				- Ship gets UnderwaterCurrents object from parent world
					- May be also give OceanSurface and nuke IsUnderwater/GetWaterDepth from World
			- Rendered (via option):
				- Texture is distorted depending on force field
				- TBD: see moleskine

	- Dynamite that may be thrown to the ship

	- Dive bomb:
		- The player drops it the sky and into the sea; the bomb goes below the waves for a bit and then refloats and
		  hits the bottom of the ship
		- Needs frontier

	- Breaking waves (Muller's paper)

	- Test:
		- Self-adjustment of kSpring and kDamp based off paper's formula (H and L bounds)
		- Debug to see if bounds ever exceeded

	- Frozen structure (*):
		- Physics:
			- Prep: allow temperatures to go below 0 but exponentially towards -273.15
				- Check curve for Dt=?Dq/T
				- At:
					- Air temperature
					- Water temperature
					- CoolBlaster tool
					- ...and everywhere else we update Points.Temperature
			- Freezing effect: simply, in low-frequency spring coeffs' Update(), also do other side of temperature spectrum:
				- With breaking length becoming smaller
				- With rest lengths staying the same
					- Or negligibly smaller? Or negligibly larger? To simulate volume change...
				- Stiffness approaches 1.0 (when from below, e.g. for rope)
		- Shader:
			- Reuse shader's temperature buffer: when negative, clamp by personality seed
				- And personality seed is also needed by shader for color saturation
				- Add personality seed to set of immutable attributes, uploaded @ beginning
			- Another idea: use this: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XXXyRr

	- Stars with database
		- python script to generate binary maps for N and S emispheres

	- Torpedoes and missiles and mines
		- "You place one down and click where it speeds off to and explodes at. Basically a moving bomb that explodes
		   when it reaches a destination, be that under water, or on the water."
		- "Missiles: like before, but above water"
		- Doesn't require collision detection right away; would detonate:
			- By button
			- By proximity with an AABB
			- (w/collision detection) by collision
		- Might either have own propulsion or follow a vector specified with click-and-drag
		- Also other objects might be launched with click-and-drag
		- Ideally, have their own physical body - kinda like (or exactly like) another ship

	- Ripple: "basically you click and hold somewhere on the ship, and when you let go, it sends a ripple into the ship, weak points might tear,
	  or start getting damaged, etc."


- Game Interactions and Controls:

	- Randomized start
		- Done by new method at SettingsManager, by choosing settings (system & user) weighted by new optional probability attribute
			- Proability at SettingsDialog
			- "defaults" (not a setting, just hardcoded) have own hardcoded probability
		- Add new system settings, with probs:
			- Starry night 0/10
			- Quiet sea 4/10
			= Blue world (sky: 0, 119, 196; find ocean, rest like quiet sea) 2/10
		- Triggered on/off via Game Preferences
			- Default off

	- Ship carries with it:
		- Overriding/addition of materials
		- Sounds (Ship Custom Sounds (*))
		- Changes to settings

	- Interior layer (multiple textures):
		- NOTE: not really useful as normally different textures require different structures
		- JSON: texture is optionally an array
		- ShipDefinition: texture is vector
			- Always non-empty
		- GameEventHandler::OnShipLoaded tells how many textures
		- MainFrame menu item: "Toggle Ship Layer"
			- Initially disabled
		- MainFrame @ OnShipLoaded enables/disables menu item based on whether at least 1 ship has > 1 textures
			- Stores count of textures as well
		- ShipRenderContext has array of textures
		- RenderContext->ShipRenderContext::ToggleShipTexture(int advance)
			- ShipRenderContext swaps textures
		- Merge multi-layered ships
		- Test
		- How to Guide

	- New tool: slingshot
		- "You hold down the left click, and pull back and aim - and it would fire somethin like a cannon ball or wrecking ball like projectile"

- UI:
	- Automatic contrast for the cursor, e.g. for when it's at depth

	- Searchbar for settings

	- Settings window: would be better to just have the settings properly minimize and have it be visible either when you use the button or search for it in the taskbar,
	  rather than the current annoying behavior

	- Also "clock time since last reload" would be helpful
		- Add Game Preferences radio to select clock type

	- ShipLoadDialog improvements:
		- Display folders in grid
			- If we want to keep them as info tiles, sorting need to leave them at bottom - e.g. by always sorting them last
				- We would also need different new info tile types: file or folder

	- Localization:
		- Keyboard shortcuts
			- But also MainFrame needs to know mappings, as it's MainFrame that reacts to key presses
		- Make NotificationLayer text translatable too
			- Requires a LocalizedText instance, passed to GameController from MainFrame
				- At this point, replace "ProgressMessage" enum with simply "Message" enum, and move localization of progress messages from splash screen to LocalizedText
			- But requires fonts
		- Ships' electrical panel labels:
			- First off, verify JSON can contain UTF-8 chars
			- Then, allow multi-language labels: label value is either string or {Lang, String}
		- MSI Installer

	- Customizable key bindings for settings

	- Ship descriptions: use Mike's drawings

- Sounds:

	- Ship Custom Sounds (*)
		- Ship may come with custom sound(s) for horns et al 
		- New electrical material: "Custom sound switch"; first one plays sound #1, second one play sound #2, etc.
		- Need to find way for ship-loading process to communicate sound file (buffer) to SoundController
			- At Electrical announcement! passing buffer as MemoryStream, or filename
		- Might be better done after ship builder, so that we may package sounds better in .shp2 files

	- Voices:
		- For ships with engine and electric systems, a voice says "Half Ahead on Engine 3" or "Pumps ON" and things like that, of course depends on the game´s language, 
		  for example in spanish it will be "Media Velocidad en Motor 3" and "Bombas Encendidas"
			- Joadix for Spanish
			- Tim for English
		- Multiple voices for the same sound
		- Disabled by default (people might hate them)

	- Sounds that play before ship starts sinking
		- SOS, bell, sailor screaming, etc.
		- Office TimCan provides the sounds

	- Morse code sound when it's about to sink (early sink detection)
		- Or at first drop of water
		- Morse code: text-to-morse encoder would be cool
			- Default "S.O.S.", also customizable via ship property

	- New sounds:
		- Ship sinking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f2B_bzcgV8
		- ShipSoundsForFS (in Scratch)

	- Sound space (*):
		- 1) Volume of effects should depend on distance/zoom
			- "Sounds' volumes that depend on the distance of their source from the visible field"
		- 2) Position of effects (L/R) should depend on world position re: camera
		- Tracking positions:
			- Events take global object ID
			- SoundController can access Position() buffer of each ship, and thus access positions at Update() and update
			  sound position

	- Sounds rearc:
		- ISoundManager
			- Implemented by both single sounds and composite/aggregates
			- Reset() // full reset, including container-stuff
			- Pause()/Resume()
			- SetMuted(isMuted, Group)
			- SetGroupVolume(vol, Group)
		- Sound (or "GameSound")
			! Base of all simple sounds
			- cctor(...Group...)
			- GetGroup()
			- SetGroupVolume(float)
				- On top of SetMasterVolume & SetVolume

-Probing:
	- IProbe:
		- World and Ship take shared_ptr<IProbe> and store it, exactly like IGameEventHandler
		- Single instance of IProbe is ProbePanel, which is given to GameController::cctor by Frame at initialization
		- Example IProbe methods:
			- void ProbeWaterSplashed(float waterSplashed)
				- One scalar, pass through to ScalarTimeSeriesProbeControl (iff IsActive)
			- void ProbePointForces(vec2f const *)
				- For other things at different steps in the simulation algorithm
				- IProbe knows whether it cares about a specific point and, if so, takes that and draw is
				- IProbe might also create stats
	= ProbePanel
		+ Pre-created member of MainFrame
		+ Then exposes Update() invoked by MainFrame, always, after simulation step
		+ Update():
			+ if not visible, return;
			+ Draw current Statistics from current StatisticsProbe
		- TBD: mechanism to select point, etc. from ship, which will be used for probing afterwards
	- Histograms:
		- class Histogram
			- map<float, float in [0,1]>
		- class Statistics (various Histograms, etc.)
			- Histogram pointWaterHistogram
			- ...

- Resource Packs

	- Resource pack contains:
		- Subset of textures
		- Subset of shaders
		- Subset of settings
		- Subset of materials, and new materials
	- Impl:
		- Data\Resources\{Default, <Pack name>}\
			- Textures\
			- Shaders\
			- settings.json
			- materials_structural.json
			- materials_electrical.json
			- metadata.json
				- author, description, name
			- Misc\
				- For ocean bumps
		- ResourceLocator:
			- Static methods only for default paths
				- e.g.: GetDefaultTextureDatabaseFilepath()
			- 1 static method to get list of non-default ResourcePackMetadata's
			- cctor takes optional pack name
			- Instance methods for *optional* pack-override paths
				- e.g.: GetOverrideTextureDatabaseFilepath()
			- Each "DB"'s Create(...) takes a ResourceLocator const &
				- Own responsibility to check if override exists and, if so, to load override and reconciliate
			- No more methods that load DB's
		- Switching:
			- Ad-hoc MainFrame dialog showing ResourcePackMetadata's
				- Chosen one goes to UIPreferencesManager
				- Checkbox for "Set as default" => UIPreferencesManager::Save()
				- At Save, before saving - notify that a reload is necessary

- Multiple ships:
	- Better done after collision detection
	- When ship loaded (added):
		- World adds it not to mShips, but as opt<Ship> mPendingShip
			- Not considered in Update(), but considered in Render()
		- MainFrame begins new PendingShipPlace tool
			- OnMouseMove: tell GameController (->World) mouse position as GameController::MovePendingShipTo(screen coords)
				- Ship::MoveTo(world x, y):
					- Moves all Points by (x,y)-mCurrentRepresentativePosition
						- Ship::mCurrentRepresentativePosition (init'd as {0,0}) tracks current "center"
					- mCurrentRepresentativePosition = (x,y)
			- OnLDown:
				- Tell GameController (DropPendingShip(x, y)) which:
					- Tells World via World::DropPendingShip(x, y):
						- Final Ship::MoveTo()
						- Move ship from mPendingShip into mShips
					- Fires IGameEventHandler::OnPendingShipPlaced(shipId)
						- EventTicker: say this and other Reset/Load
						- SoundController: play sound
				- Stop PendingShipPlace tool

- Passengers:
	- Ship has number of passengers
		- "like how many people would be aboard & as the ship sinks it like shows how many people are alive, escaped via life boat or died"
		- Maybe a life count? like you have sorta a life count on the top right of the screen that says Alive: number. Dead: Number.
		  And as the ship is sinking you press a button like say A (abandon) for example and people will start heading to the life boats
		  to survive. The counter will stop once the ship is fully under the surface of the ocean or the entire boat deck is under water.
		  The boat deck would be highlighted sorta like how the light system works.

	- Moving passengers
		- Separate layer provides floors, ladders, and obstacles
		- Can get away at beginning with pacman-like figures
		- For more realistic version:
			- Skeleton with 10 parts (8 limbs, body, head)
			- Need to make these actions:
				- Walk
				- Fall
				- Climb
				- Swim

- Collision detection - for multiple ships
	- Nearest neighbor: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/

	+ Point & Spring Destructuring:

		+ Main goal: improve cache locality
		+ Secondary goal: make vectorization-friendly
		+ Replace Point, Spring, Triangle with Points, Springs, Triangles
			+ Base is ElementContainer
				+ Defines aliases (ElementCount, ElementIndex) - uint32
				+ ElementCount GetCount() const
					- Number of elements
					- passed at cctor
			+ They contain N buffers:
				+ Points: Position, Velocity, Force, MassFactor, Color, Water, IsDeleted ...
					+ All scalars of a point that are only used for both x and y (e.g. MassFactor) are stored
					 (and updated, if any) twice, as vec2f (only MassFactor?)
					+ All scalars of a point that are used as scalars (e.g. Buoyancy) are stored once
					+ Test first to see if N buffers make a difference vs 1 larger buffer:
						+ 1: Do Position, Velocity, Force, and MassFactors first in single Newtonz buffer
							+ Get baseline 1:

					+ If makes sense to explode:
						+ Also explode ConnectedComponent
				+ Phase 2: Springs: Points, dynamics coefficients, water coefficients, ...
				+ Phase 2: Triangles: Points, Network
				+ Phase 2: Change all ElementContainer::ElementIndex into ElementIndex
				+ Structure of buffers:
					+ For SSE2, need to be simple floats
					+ For handling, need to be structured
				+ Buffers are class Buffer
					+ Need to be mem-aligned
					+ cctor(size)
					+ data()/size()/emplace_back()
					+ uq_ptr
			+ They expose buffer getters for each buffer (as the structured type, e.g. vec2f *, or PointNetwork *, or float * for lonely scalars)
				+ e.g. vec2f* GetPositionBuffer()
				+ When needed also exposed as floats as well (e.g. Position, for Integrate())
					+ e.g. float* GetPositionBufferAsFloat()
					+ size math left to caller
			+ When needed, they expose getters and generally operations on single elements, via 32-bit index argument (aliased as ElementIndex)
				+ e.g. void Destroy(ElementIndex)
				+ e.g. float GetMass(ElementIndex)
			+ Destroy(ElementIndex) takes care of telling ship that element count is dirty
				+ Phase 3: set directly in Ship at initiation of Destroy chain, whenever we know we destroy something
					+ Do at Spring::UpdateStrain: returns bool, true if destroyed
					+ Do at tool's Destroy
					+ Then get rid of two-phase ship cctor - plain cctor with moved ElementRepo's
						+ So can also remove move assignment at Points
			+ Pointers to points are replaced by 32-bit indices
				+ Funcs that need to follow pointers (e.g. Destroy() and SpringDynamics()) also must take whole containers
				+ Phase 2: also pointers to Springs & Triangles
			+ ShipBuilder creates Points & moves into ship
				+ Points' ConnectedXYZ are updated at ShipBuilder time
					+ Remove code from Spring and Triangle and ElectricalElement-Cable-etc. cctors
			+ Do Ship
				+ Loop over indices, invoking Points::GetWhatever(index)
			+ End of Phase 1: FPS=22.0/22.3/22.6
			+ Phase 1.5: check assembly for:
				+ 1: loop over indices, invoking Points::GetWhatever(index)
				+ 2: loop over indices, taking buffers first and then dereferencing buffer with index
				+ RESULT: IDENTICAL
				+ Decide whether to keep bunch of GetWhatever(index) (both R and W) vs buffers
				+ Check also disassembly of index iterator
			+ End of Phase 1.5: FPS=23.2/23.3/23.4
			+ To check:
				+ UpdateDrawForces: see assembly difference for displacement.length() optimization
					+ NO, actually compiler autonomously saves length for later, and explicit
					  code looks a bit different
				+ UpdateSpringForces(): see assembly to check whether point.Force's are updated twice
					+ YES
					+ Update force once with sum of forces
				+ HandleCollisionsWithSeaFloor(): see assembly to check for twice GetPosition()
					+ YES, read once into xmm4 and re-used later
			+ End of checks after Phase 1.5: FPS=24.0/24.2/24.4
			+ Containers expose own Upload(RenderContext &)
				+ Phase 3: direct upload of buffers into GPU via RenderContext
					+ Nuke ShipRenderContext::mPointBuffer & friends
				+ Phase 3: move texture coordinates and colors into Points, which uploads
				  at Upload() via own mAreImmutablePropertiesUploaded state
					+ Nuke Ship::mIsPointCountDirty
					+ Nuke ElementRepository, as at this moment no one should be using it anymore
			+ Phase 3: Nuke PointerContainer
			+ Phase 3: Nuke ShipElement, if it's now only implemented by ElectricalElement
				+ See if managed to not need to tell Ship as well, see above
			+ Phase 3:
				+ Fix power-of-2 calculation at Buffer::cctor()
				+ Fix World::GetNearestPointIndexAt, by making use of Ship::GetPointPosition(idx)
					+ See square root optimization, here and @ Destroy()
				+ Also fix its use at MainFrame, by making use of Ship::GetStuff()
				+ Fix all warnings
		+ Phase 2: Integrate():
			+ After NewtonzBuffer exploded
			+ Test 1: use Points.GetWhatever(idx)
			+ FPS=24.7/24.8/25.0
			+ Test 2: use __restrict pointers
				+ Just simple 1-Point-Component loop, compiler makes times four
				+ Pointers are locally declared as __restrict, and adjusts count (i.e. times 2) and uses
				  indices in pointers
				+ Verify assembly
			+ FPS=24.9/25.1/25.2
		+ Phase 1:
			+ Beginning FPS=19.0/19.4/19.7/19.9

	+ StatusText/TextLayer replacement (*)
		! Slot-ification of text in text layer, with exhausted slots scrolling up
		+ Replace GameLib::StatusText with new TextLayer class
			+ Owned by GameController
			+ Talks directly to TextRenderContext (see below)
			+ Two sets of methods:
				+ 1: State-modifying:
					+ TextLayer::SetStatusTextes()/Enable
					+ TextLayer::AddEphemeralText(lines[], float lifetimeSeconds)
						+ Standard fade-in/stay/fade-out
						+ Handles slots and their rotation
				+ 2: void Update()
					+ Does things againts TextRenderContext, which will be rendered autonomously later by TextRenderContext
		+ TextLayer takes shared_ptr<TextRenderContext> in cctor
			+ Given by GameController, who takes it from RenderContext
			! RenderContext will forfait wrapping of text API's
		+ TextRenderContext cares about single-line texts only
			+ Make sure multiple-line support is not for perf
			+ API exposed:
				+ AddText:
					- text (1 line)
					- Justification
						- TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft, BottomRight
						- Implicit: l/r/t/b (screen-)margins
					- offsetScreenX
						- Meant to be distance from horizontal component of justification
						- Margin is added implicitly
						- For effects
					- offsetScreenY
						- Meant to be distance from vertical component of justification
						- Margin is added implicitly
						- Also provides getter for (screen-)height of line for font, and getter for fixed (screen-)v inset between lines
					- alpha
					- font
				+ UpdateText: different versions for:
					+ text only
					+ alpha only
					+ offsets only
				+ RemoveText
			+ Cleanup:
				+ Nuke old API
				+ Remove RenderContext's forwarding of API's
			+ Optimize alpha+offset update
		+ GameController:

			+ Nuke StatusText
				+ Also source files
			+ Expose DisplayLoadedLastPlayedSettingsNotification()
	+ SettingsManager: save settings, defaults, and real-time changes (*)
		+ Spec:

			+ Changing settings in the GUI puts them in effect immediately
				+ ...and GameController will smooth them
			+ Loaded settings go to GameController

				+ OceanFloorTerrain
					+ Has unique_buffer<float>

				+ OceanFloor contains and owns OceanFloorTerrain
					+ Needs it as a member as it exposes reference to it
				+ OceanFloor cctor needs to take default OceanFloorTerrain as && from outside, i.e.
				  from World who takes it from GameController as &&
					+ GameController provides the initial one loaded via
					  OceanFloorTerrain::LoadFromImage(ResourceManager::path of default system one)
				+ GameController::Reset():
					+ First takes current terrain, via World
					+ Then, passes it back to World's cctor, as &&
				+ Crash when reloading after having written last sample
				+ IGameController (and OceanFloor):
					+ Get[OceanFloor]Terrain() const -> OceanFloorTerrain const &
					+ Set[OceanFloor]Terrain(OceanFloorTerrain const &)
				+ Test:
					+ Default terrain at beginning
						+ Double-check interpolation we do at image->terrain algo
					+ Precision of adjusted terrain
					+ Reset: maintains manually-adjusted terrain
			+ FloatingSandbox/SettingsManager.h

							+ Stops smoothing, updates mTargetValue with clamped value, and sets
							- Unit tests, w/subsequent Update() call which should be nop
						+ I/GameController has also SetOceanDepthImmediate(.)
						+ BaseSettingsManager has two enforcers, second one is "Immediate"
							+ Exposes new EnforceDirtySettings"Immediate"(.)
							+ EnforceDefaultsAndLastModifiedSettings(.) calls "Immediate"
							+ Unit tests, verify each is called only when expected and not when not expected
						+ All callers of (Base)SettingsManager::EnforceDirtySettings(.) should check whether they need
						  to call EnforceDirtySettings"Immediate"(.) instead
							+ SettingsDialog: all but OnLiveSettingsChanged(.)
						+ SettingsManager populates second "Immediate" set of enforcers
				+ See if need bold for system settings
					+ Need wxListCtrl
		+ Small rearc:

					! void LoadAndEnforceLastPlayedSettings()
				+ To:
					! void LoadPersistedSettings(key, settings &) // only loaded dirty on output
					+ void EnforceDefaultsAndPersistedSettings(key) -> Settings (all clean)
					+ void EnforceDefaultsAndLastModifiedSettings() -> void
						+ Just calls above w/standard key
			+ See why ocean floor settings appear to be superimposed
				+ It's just OceanDepth for one, and custom for other
			+ Have two different "load" buttons:
				+ 1) "Apply Settings": "Loads the settings and applies them on top of the current settings." (i.e. current behavior)
				+ 2) "Revert to Settings": "Reverts all settings to the saved settings." (i.e. enforce {Defaults+Loaded} rather than just Loaded)
			+ Make "last-played" really "Last-Modified"; i.e.:
				+ Settings.h/cpp:
					+ Rename

					+ Clicking on it toggles asc/desc for sorting, and bitmap
				+ By: Name, Date added, Year Built, HD/Elec/0
					~ Date added: see after install if file creation dates are still originals
				+ Sorting impl @ PreviewWindow:

					+ Vector of info tiles is assumed to be always sorted by the currently-selected method
						+ Change InfoTile: needs to become agnostic of own position in grid, which also needs to be recalc'd a) at each new InfoTile, and b) at each change of sorting
						+ Replace those members with functions that go to and from linear position in InfoTile vector to VirtualRect
						+ Do strongly-typed ship file ID
					+ Do sorting						
						+ Has std::function "sort predicate" member, memoized by SetSortMethod/Direction()
							+ Make non-metadata tiles (e.g. errors) always appear at end - do not use direction here

				+ GameController also gives rope renderColour to RenderContext at cctor
					+ Which sets shader's hardcoded parameter
	+ Try light diffusion rearc:
		+ No more at C++, but rather in OpenGL as in the following example (written for ShipTriangles only but valid also for springs
		  and points):
			+ Prerequisite: draw ship triangles by connected component (see above)
			+ Turn off diffusion
			+ For each component: pass array of all lamps in that component; each lamp has {x, y, intensity};
			+ Draw each connected component N times (use additive blending), once for each lamp,
			  each time passing the single lamp properties as uniform to shaders,
			  which calculate distance and do final light blending
				+ Check right way of doing blending
		+ REJECTED: perf was awful; this multiple-pass way of doing it hurts too much

	+ Texture mapping:
		+ UploadLandAndWaterStart()/./End()
			+ Just specify land y and water y
			+ Impl:
				+ y:
					+ To LandBuffer
					+ To WaterBuffer
			+ RenderLand()
			+ RenderWater()
		+ Land (sand)
			+ bottom is not anymore a param but it's filled by RenderLadn(.) with +/- mWorldHeight/2
				+ only param is x and y (world y)
			+ texture coordinates are world coordinates
			+ Magic number is based on desired tile world size
		+ Water
			+ Use "water transparency" uniform in shader that sets alpha value in result of texture
			+ Make texture stretch wrt vertical height of water strip
			+ Change map, this one's ugly
		+ Clouds
			+ Use N textures, each has own rectangular size
			+ RenderContext loads all available textures and uses them for the clouds, modulo
				+ ResourceLoader::LoadTexturesRgba(prefix)
					+ initProgressSink lambda
			+ GameParameters.NumberOfClouds (constants)
			+ World takes numberOfClouds and allocates clouds buffer with random values
			+ Then, RenderContext::RenderCloudsStart()/./End()
				+ Buffer contains virtualX and virtualY, and scale
				+ RenderContext::RenderCloud() makes rectangles (in world coords) based off formula
			+ Clouds stencil:
				+ Draw waterbuffer without texture, but reverse stencil op
		+ Ship, using second image
			+ Load ship == image or .shp (JSON)
			+ First, try naively with just point colors
				+ Doesn't work, as structural image has too little resolution
			+ RenderContext is given optional texture image (by GameController) via
			  RenderContext::AddShip(iShip, opt<ImageData>)
			  + Requires RenderContext::ResetWorld()
				+ Simply clears vector of ShipRenderContext()
					+ ShipRenderContext contains everything ship-related
						+ Rename springs and triangles to "Elements"
						+ Touch points with outside world:
							+ Parameters (booleans, render factors)
							+ OrthoMatrix
							+ Helpers
				+ No need to reset others (land, water, clouds) as their numbers, positions, and data will be given
				  at the next Render() from scratch
					+ But it could easily by re-creating uq_ptr<XYZRenderContext()>
				+ Call from GameController
			  + Adds ship with opt<ImageData> in arg
				+ If specd, cctor creates <OpenGLTexture mElementTexture> and uploads immediately
				+ mShipTextureCoordinatesVBO and other texture machinery is created at startup anyway (if any)
				+ No need for std::optional<ImageData> TextureImageData
			  + Remembers if ship has texture via mElementTexture
			  + Catch exceptions at all interactions of MainFrame with GameController, and display DialogBox
			  + ResourceLoader::LoadShipDefinition: need to make paths abs wrt .shp path
			  + Refactor to World::CreateShip() -> ID -> Ship::Create()
			  + Land and Water texture names: do own, not from array
			  + Always unbind texture2d after a render
			+ Also, later, RenderContext is also given textureCoords,
			  i.e. a buffer of texture X's and Y's (i.e. initial points' coords) for
			  each of the ship points (i.e. aligned with the point buffer which will be continuosly uploaded)
			  + TextureCoords created by Ship::Create (always), stored into Ship, and given to RenderContext
			    (which uploads it, always) once and for all at the same time as colors (i.e. when IsPointCountDirty)
			+ If a texture is associated with the ship, RenderContext uses a different shader for ShipTriangles
			+ Krafting:
				+ Y offset for initial drop
				+ Remove one layer of hull from bottom, but see how much it bends afterwards

			+ OpenGLGame::UploadMipmappedTexture(imageData) -> void
				+ Does base and all the dimensions down to 1x1, using floored extents
				+ Algo: take avg of each square of points, including alpha
			+ Use GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR
			+ See https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Texture
			+ Then nuke ImageData stored in RenderContext's
			+ Use at:
				+ Ship
				+ Remove from Land? Test w/out and see if border
			+ Test perf
	+ VectorField rendering
		+ Final cleanups:
			+ Check all vector fields wrt deleted points

		+ Copied right before integration
	+ Orphaned points
		+ Idea: always draw orphaned points - those that come after destruction
		+ Orphaned point == points with 0 connected springs
		+ We unify ephemeral points uploading and rendering with ship points (either debug or orphan) uploading and rendering
			+ Plane ID is enough to keep them on separate planes
		+ Verify first that connectivity visit really assigns plane IDs also to orphaned points
		+ Impl:
			+ We must first stop deleting points just because springs are deleted
				+ Though should still delete them at Destroy() and Bomb(), for example
			+ Unify non-ephemeral and ephemeral points in element VBO
				+ Need hint from Points on whether or not ephemerals will follow
			+ ShipRenderContext:
				+ Nuke RenderEphemeralPoints and its structs and members
				+ Have just one single RenderPoints
					+ Always invoked, except when DebugShipRenderMode is not None and not Points
					  (i.e. when it's Springs, EdgeSprings, etc. but not Points)

	+ Continuous auto-focus (*)
		! Spec:
			- Orchestrated by GameController's ViewManager by taking "optimal" AABB from World (which takes union of "optimal" AABB's from each ship)
			  and giving it to RenderContext, which adjusts ViewModel based on it				
				- At each simulation step
			- Preferences setting for auto-focus (default is on)
				- Also toggable at "Controls" menu
			- Also works as "auto-focus at load"
				- Or at least, funcs that calc zoom and pan based on AABBs is reused (by same ViewManager) in order to calc auto-focus at load
			- Full spec:
				- Orchestrated by ViewManager, member of GameController
					- Is given (externally-owned) references to RenderContext& and NotificationLayer&, managing all communication to these wrt view params
					- Owns view parameter smoothers						
					- GameController forwards view parameter changes to it
						- And ViewManager orchestrates talk with its own smoothers
				- Given resulting AABBs by GameController at own Update(), called after World::Update
				- Communicates activation and (also unsolicited) de-activation via new event handler, subscribed by:
					- MainFrame for option
					- GameController for notification texture
						- Can't do it itself via own NofificationLayer?
				- When user changes view params, we add offset to cumulative offset, which is then added to final result of auto-focus
					- So if user e.g. zooms out, the whole auto-focus is zoomed out
		+ Impl:
			+ Phase 1: ViewManager extraction
				+ Parameter smoothers: simplify by simply using convergence algo, coeff between 0.05 and 0.1
			+ Phase 2: rough auto-focus
				+ Make it so that World may be asked for AABBSet right after adding ship
				+ ViewManager::Update takes AABBSet
				+ AABBSet/visible world math
			+ Phase 3: improve auto-focus
				+ Try with continuous adjustments
				+ Calculations by ViewModel are on view model params being smoothed towards target; may lead to ghost offenses
					+ Need to make calculations based on target values; may test with "Immediate"
				+ See if can use tolerance to make adjustments less continuous
					X Decide if user may select tolerance - MAY BE NOT
				+ Simplify auto-zoom and pan calc's
			+ Phase 4: user's offsets
				! Cannot user smoothers' values when calculating auto-focus, unless we downscale them by user's offsets - which could have changed
					! This is because we want to calculate auto-focus and panning on the "screen" without user's offsets
				+ Need to store auto-focus zoom and camera pos - without user's offsets - and use those for calculating auto-focus
					+ Need to initialize them at auto-focus enable - with current smoothers' values
				+ Double-check math
				+ Fix user offset pile-up issue everywhere
					+ Do at update, eroding along direction, without crossing 1.0/origin
						+ Pan
							+ Erode x and y independently
						+ Zoom
				+ Autozoom-on-load:
					+ "Auto-zoom on load" setting moves to ViewManager
					+ ViewManager::OnNewShip(AABB...): if "auto-zoom on load" is on and no auto-focus: invoke AutoFocus(AABB...)
						+ Fix invocation without auto-focus session
							+ Just plain calc zoom and pan
							+ Fix issue: subsequent announcement generates resize hence OnViewModelUpdated() sets smoothers to current RenderContext values,
							  which are still way before convergence
								+ Used to work because of auto-focus doing SetValueImmediate()
								+ Reclamp
						+ Reset user offsets at FocusOnShip(), ResetView()
						+ Invoke from GameController
							+ See why first load doesn't focus
							+ Decide if we still want "ship reload" to NOT do auto-zoom
								+ Also decide whether we still don't want first load to do auto-zoom
								+ Test by turning off auto-focus
								+ Fix GameController accordingly
					+ ViewManager::AutoFocus: if auto-focus not set: invoke (private) DoAutoFocus() [; else: pointless as subsequent Update() will invoke DoAutoFocus()]
						+ DoAutoFocus(AABB...) contains implementation of zoom+pan
							+ Invoked also by Update()
			+ Clouds: better effect: clouds' NDC y should flatten quicker for lower CAM y - now it flattens linearly 
				+ Test storm
				+ Exponential: ste precalc'd member(s) @ Clouds::UploadStart()
			+ Test with auto-zoom filling-in larger sub-window
			+ Try other auto-focus algo
				+ 1: calc zoom as min zoom to ensure four quadrants
				+ 2: calc pan to center that
				+ New current *targets* of user offsets
					+ Or better: use SessionData->CurrentAutoFocusXXX
				X Try using current *ephemeral value* instead of targets
				+ If OK:
					+ Cleanup
					+ Update explanation/comment
			X Test faster convergence
			+ Do test w/goodyear
			+ Phase 5: enabling/disabling
				+ Main UI
					+ "Auto-Focus on Load"

			+ Fix "pulsating zoom" issue
				+ Do more tests and see if really perfection
				+ If perfection:
					+ Cleanup
					+ Test with zoom first, like it used to be
			+ Thanos fix
			+ Phase 6: tuning
				+ Immediate pan: done smoothly in all cases?
				+ See if need different zoom and pan speeds, for "focus on ship" case
				X Try stateful threshold for cam Y; once through, no threshold
					X At least we damp initial waves
				+ Play with threshold algos
					+ CameraY Smoothstep route
						+ Test based on NDC (smoothstep on NDC fraction) rather than world
							+ Commit first
				+ If not ok: nuke threshold code
					+ But do keep updating mAutoFocus->CurrentXXX
			+ Remove every-other-frame thing
			+ Test for user offset accumulation problem, which is due to calculated pan being "too much", so user offset has to first counterbalance that before being able to make a difference:
				+ Clamp auto-focus only, *then* continue
			+ Cleanup:
				+ See if can nuke ParameterSmoother::IsSmoothing
				+ Move focus and pan calc'n out so may be reused by CenterOnShip
				+ See if can nuke local variables for "newAutoFocusXXX" and use mAutoFocus->CurrrentXXX instead
				+ See if still need all ViewModel methods (World<->Ndc)
				+ Icon				
				+ Take care of initial auto-zoom
			+ See if can do AutoFocus once every N frames
		+ Check if we were updating smoothers during pause
		+ Tests:
			+ Loading ship which has no frontiers: check behavior for all combinations of autofocus/autozoom
			+ Load under pause
			+ See perf impact on old Dell - UNNOTICEABLE!

+ Gfx Optimizations:
	+ Try without buffer population:
		+ Point has vec2f * const mPosition and vec2f * const mColour, pointing into two fixed buffers
			+ vectors are packed (static_assert on contiguous 2 or 3)
			+ Point does not live in PointerContainer but in std::uq_ptr<Point>[]
				+ Delete does nothing (Destroy does relationships though), just marks it
		+ Point also has mElementIndex, queried by springs and triangles when rendering themselves
			+ Can make Ship::Render const again, then
		+ Pointers to fixed buffers (as arrays of vectors) are owned by Ship and
		  are given by Ship to RenderContext at each Render via
		  RenderContext::UploadVertices(vec2f*, vec3f*, count)
		+ RenderContext usage of two buffers at each DrawElements:
			glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertexBuffer);

			glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, colorBuffer);
			glVertexAttribPointer(vertexColorAttribute, 4, GL_FLOAT, false, 0, 0);
			glEnableVertexAttribArray(vertexColorAttribute);
		+ Point's vector pointers are populated by Point::Rebase(buf1, buf2),
		  invoked by Ship at construction
			+ Rebase() uses mPointIndex (rename of mElementIndex) to calc pointers
		+ Try: could also use buffer with mLight and mWater (uploaded each time to GPU as well) to be used by V->F shader
		  to blend fragColor with two fixed colors (water blended before ambient light, light after)
			+ F shader needs to start doing ambient light now, rather than point
			+ Need Point::CalculateWaterColorIntensity() (clamps and copies mWater to buffer),
			  and a dummy Point::FinalizeLightColorIntensity() (dummy because mLight is already finalized)
			  + or do clamp in shader, so use mWater and mLight straight from buffer, no CalculateX() needed
			+ If we put light and water in shader, then we don't need to reupload color buffer each time
		+ Bonus: also test GPU interpolation of mLight and mWater by emitting them at vertex
	+ Plan:
		+ 0: Test with additional mLight and mWater uploaded to RenderContext (same Point struct), and fragment shader doing math
			+ F Shader needs params: ambientLightIntensity; constants: waterColor, lightColor
			+ Remove point color calculation
			+ Check perf:

						+ Then uploads to GPU right away, with GL_STREAMING_DRAW
		+ Final:
			+ Nuke Point::CalculateColour
			+ Also do light/water color blending at ship *point* fragment shader
	+ Only keep separate color buffer and water/light done in F shader; point disembodiment was not a good idea

	+ Pack vertex attributes @ other shaders:

	+ Texture atlas:
		+ Spec:
			+ Atlas is built on-the-fly, completely independently from texture DB, via a separate
			  component (TextureAtlasBuilder) that is given multiple TextureFrame's and eventually spits out TextureAtlas
			+ TextureAtlas:
				+ Contains:
					+ image: consumed by GameOpenGL helper for mipmapping
					+ metadata: used by GameOpenGL helper for mipmapping, owned by RenderContext (for clouds, land, and water)
					  and (by reference) by ShipRenderContext (for GenericTextures)
				+ Structure:
					+ ImageData Texture
					+ TextureAtlasMetadata Metadata:
						+ TextureAtlasFrameMetadata:
							+ box in atlas (i.e. texture coords, as 2xvec2f)
							+ TextureFrameMetadata
						+ vector<TextureAtlasFrameMetadata> / anything else addressable via TextureFrameId (see above)
			+ Separate mipmapper helper in GameOpenGL takes ImageData (by move) and TextureAtlasMetadata
		+ Impl:
			+ Phase 1: Clouds
				+ TextureAtlas
				+ ResourceLoader::SaveImage
				+ Resize all clouds to powers of two
					+ Test look & feel
				+ RenderContext:
					+ Cctor: create atlas and add just Clouds
					+ Upload texture - w/no mipmap for the time being
					+ Store Metadata (by value) and handle
					+ Use Atlas metadata at UploadClouds()
				+ Test 1

						+ Make builder stateful
					+ Pass Metadata and texture handle to ShipRenderContext
					+ Bind:

						+ Land, Water before land and water
				+ ShipRenderContext must take from RenderContext:
					+ Atlas texture handle (&), for binding it at GenericTextures
						+ At least until we do Z and GenericTextures moves up to RenderContext

					+ Publicly exposed
					+ Populated via argument (of type std::array<ElementIndex, 3>) at Triangles:Add
						+ Calc'd by ShipBuilder
					+ Never changed
					+ Used by Ship::TrianglesDestroyHandler() to decrement count for each component spring
			+ Triangle destroy: remove self from springs
			+ Springs destroy: remove self from super triangles
			+ ShipBuilder:
				+ Adjust to new
				+ Also take care of traverse springs
			+ New ShipRenderMode: EdgeSprings only
				+ ShipRenderContext: treated exactly like SpringsOnly
				+ Springs::Render: used to decide what to upload
			+ Springs::UploadElements: in all modes except SpringsOnly, upload only springs with # of super triangles < 2
				+ Re-enable TODOTEST code
			+ Ship::Render() has to remember what ShipRenderMode was used last time, so to consider elements dirty
			  also when ShipRenderMode has changed

		+ Fix/Recheck progress bar
		+ Redo perf FPS measurement
	+ Z buffer:
		+ Rationale: more connected components => slower (multiple batches); try to draw one single batch then, using Z buffer and depth test
		+ Spec:
			+ Assign Z based on cousin of connected component ID (named "Plane ID", uint32_t)
				+ All points have PlaneId
					+ Can we revert ShipId and ConnectedComponentId to start from zero and having None=max?
						+ Yes, no one used NoneConnectedComponentId
						+ When we need stuff on top we can always use member variable with max plane ID and/or the total
						  count of ships
						+ If so, Plane ID starts from zero
					+ Own buffer (it'll have to be uploaded to GPU)
				+ Points that belong to a connected component also have ConnectedComponentId
					+ What doesn't have a ConnectedComponentId?
						+ ConnectedComponentId is used for:
							+ Frontier (possibly?)
								+ In this case we don't want to assign them to "cables" (0-triangle edges a.k.a.
								  0-SuperTriangle springs), nor to standalone points
							+ ForceFields that spring from a point
								+ But we can get rid of this and just explode all over the place, after all
								  explosions travel through air
							+ Not by light diffusion algo, see below
					+ We keep ConnectedComponentIds for future use, but do the frontier-type propagation, i.e.
					  we don't propagate them through "cables" nor assign them to standalone points; all of these
					  won't have a ConnectedComponentId at all
					+ So, what doesn't have a ConnectedComponentId?
						- "strings"
						- standalone points
				+ Assignment of PlaneId is done via the same connectivity visit used for assigning ConnectedComponentId's,
				  but we assign "single-spring paths" to the origin's PlaneId and don't propagate to solid body again
					+ So we draw as separate two pieces that are connected solely by a "cable" (**)
					+ Also rope triangles must be assigned to the origin's PlaneId
					+ Propagation algo: don't propagate if coming from a spring with zero SuperTriangles to a spring
					  with >0 SuperTriangles, unless these are all rope triangles
						+ New "IsRope" property of Triangle, pop'd by ShipBuilder; new buffer
				+ Light diffusion algo follows PlaneId's, instead of ConnectedComponentId's, as it's really about planes
				+ We assign Z after orthomatrix - in NDC - and thus positive is near
			+ We only enable Z test and writing to Z buffer at RenderContext before doing ships
				+ And later, if we move GenericTexture to RenderContext, also when we do generic textures
		+ Figure out range of Z:
			+ World: -1000 -> -1  ==> NDC: +1 -> -1
			+ We assign Z after orthomatrix - in NDC - and thus positive is near
			+ After matrix it's NDC: [-1, +1] (far, near)
			+ When given to fragment shader it's [0,+1], but we don't care anymore at this moment, as we calc Z in vertex shader!
		+ Mapping of <ShipId, PlaneId> to Z in NDC:
			+ Normal: ShipId=0 and PlaneId=0 are furthest
		+ Plan:
			+ Branch
			+ Preliminaries:
				+ Test explosions without connected component ID constraint; if ok, eradicate connected component IDs
				  from ForceFields
				+ Test perspective with hardcoded z=-1 at triangle shaders and z=-999 at springs, and see if it makes any difference
					+ Undo afterwards
				+ Do test images:
					+ Get problematic # of CC's first, with AM bomb on Titanic: 6,000
					+ ConnectedComponentsTestShip1: 8192 CC's, 33280 points, 49152 springs
					+ ConnectedComponentsTestShip2: 1 CC, 36588 points, 47882 springs
				+ Get initial perf:
					+ Default: 30.8
					+ ConnectedComponentsTestShip1: 3.10
					+ ConnectedComponentsTestShip2: 11.6
			+ Step 1:
				+ Add "PlaneID"
					+ GameType
						+ Same integral type as ConnectedComponentId
						+ Change ShipId, ConnectedComponentId, PlaneId to start from zero and have None=max (see @Spec above)
					+ Points: new buffer
				+ Points: add connected springs' "other endpoint"
					+ As part of Network
					+ Test fixed_size_vector::erase_first with/lambda
						+ Check assembly with unit tests
					+ Populated by whatever populates ConnSprings now (ShipBuilder or Points::Add)
					+ Nuke Springs::GetOtherEndpointIndex
					+ Write off work item from elsewhere in this file
				+ Run in debug and validate
					+ Revert to Render::uploading ConnCompId's
					+ Test crash w/Goliath
				+ Check perf
			+ Step 2:
				+ Connectivity visit:
					+ New PlaneId propagation (see @Spec above and Moleskine)
					+ Change ConnectedComponentId propagation to match frontier style (i.e. not on strings)
				+ Light diffusion algo now follows PlaneIds (see @Spec above and Moleskine)
				+ All the other things that currently require a ConnectedComponentId for rendering purposes:
					+ Bombs: substitute ConnCompId with PlaneId
					+ PinnedPoints: substitute ConnCompId with PlaneId
					+ Triangles: no ConnCompId nor PlaneId
					+ Spring: no ConnCompId, just PlaneId
					+ Ephemeral particles (check all Points::CreateXYZEphemeralParticle(...))
				+ Render: upload PlaneId instead of ConnectedComponentId
				+ Do ad-hoc tests to validate assignment of plane IDs and connected component IDs
				+ Run in debug and validate
				+ Commit
			+ Step 3:
				+ Ship/RenderContext: UploadPlaneIds(..., maxMaxPlaneId)
					+ Send to GPU right away, in buffer mapped to shared vertex attribute
				+ Test
				+ Commit
			+ Step 4:
				+ Enable Z test and writing to Z buffer:
					+ At RenderContext before doing ships, and disable afterwards
						+ Need World to invoke RenderShipsStart()/End() before going through individual ships
					+ Also clear Z buffer at canvas clear
					+ glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
					+ glDepthMask(GL_TRUE); // This at initialization
					+ glDepthFunc(GL_LESS); // This at initialization

				+ Commit
			+ Step 5:

									+ Changed MaxMaxPlaneId at UploadPlaneIds(...) call
				+ RenderContext ans ShipRenderContext: change OnXYZUpdated/UpdateXYX pattern: no args
				+ Test
				+ Commit
			+ Step 6:
				+ ShipRenderContext:
					+ See if can get rid of optionality of ship's texture
					+ Make dedicated shaders for each layer:
						+ Current => New:
							- Ropes: ShipRopes => ShipRopes
							- Triangles:
								- ShipTrianglesTexture: if !debug && RenderMode==Texture
								- ShipTrianglesColor: otherwise
								=> ShipTrianglesTexture, ShipTrianglesColor
							  & Springs:
								- ShipTrianglesTexture: if !debug && RenderMode==Texture
								- ShipTrianglesColor: otherwise
								=> ShipTrianglesTexture, ShipTrianglesColor
							- StressedSprings: ShipStressedSprings => ShipStressedSprings
							- Points: ShipTrianglesColor => ShipPointsColor (copy)
							- GenTex: GenericTextures => ShipGenericTextures (rename)
							- Vectors: Matte => ShipMatte (copy)
					+ Complete: assign per-layer ortho matrices
					+ Test & commit
			+ Step 7:
				+ Do actual ship ortho matrix calculation at ViewModel::CalculateShipOrthoMatrix
					+ See Moleskine for calc'ns
				+ All ship shaders take new vertex attribute and calc Z via OrthoMatrix
					+ Test first with triangles layer
					+ Do all other layers and shaders next
				+ Test all layers
				+ ShipRenderContext::UploadXYZElement() do not take anymore connected component ID
					+ Dismantle ShipRenderContext connected component tracking; store everything in buffers and/or upload directly
						+ cctor:
							+ // Elements:
								+ Reserve vectors w/maxes from old func
								+ Create VBO's
					+ Ship: nuke mConnectedComponentSizes
					+ Ship::Render:
						+ Nuke connected component empty check
						+ if mIsStructureDirty or debug mode changed:
							+ Upload parts individually
				+ Do ship triangles correct sorting
					+ Store bool owned_by_point in Points::ConnectedTriangles (see MOLESKINE)
						+ Store it sorted
					+ Replace Triangles::UploadElements() with Triangles::UploadElements<TIndices>(TIndices const &, ...)
					+ Ship:
						+ Populate std::vector<ElementIndex> at ConnectivityVisit with owned triangle indices only
							+ vector reserved at cctor
						+ ::Render(): still when mIsStructureDirty: Triangles::UploadElements(mIndices)
				+ Verify old behavior (ship triangles in texture mode are drawn incorrectly):
					+ With Titanic's back flag
					+ Temp triangles upload in old order
					+ Temp no springs draw
				+ Verify new behavior: OK
				+ Put back ShipRenderContext's Springs rendering
				+ Commit
			+ Step 8:
				+ Issues:
					+ Ropes jumping ahead (when new connected components come up)
						+ Due to incorrect planeID direction on Z axis: higher plane ID (recipient of string
						  assigned to previous (lower) plane ID) must be nearer (than string and its solid body)
					+ (Edge) springs countoured with background
						+ Testable with Titanic funnel
						+ Solution: draw triangles before all
					+ Ropes and anti-aliasing issue:
						+ Option 1: draw ropes *after* triangles and springs, but still in current layer (farther)
						- Option 2: see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30426178/lines-appear-segmented-after-enabling-depth-testing:
							- Draw ropes first (in invoke order) with Z write off (Z test is irrelevant, as it'd be the first)
								- BUT: if there's no Z write then there's no Z test among ropes, hence
								  they'd cover each other wrongly
							- Draw everything else with Z write (and Z test) on
					+ Piece of rope appears to belong to higher connected component
						+ Was to be expected - after all last segment of rope is between two points that have
						  two different plane IDs, hence a part of the last segment will be visible
						+ Possible solution is to stop doing the "smart" string plane propagation altogether
					+ When pieces belong to same plane, (edge) springs are drawn in disagreement with triangles
					  (e.g. triangles invisible but their edge springs visible)
						+ Option 1: springs are drawn in layer Z-behind
						- Option 2: depth-sort springs as well
					+ After we start drawing ropes temporally after triangles (because of anti-aliasing issue):
						+ Ropes are now occluded by transparent (texture) triangles from same plane
							+ This is because ropes layer is Z-behind triangles layer
							+ Option 1: alpha test in shader
					+ Same plane: covering is now more random
						+ Analyze visit pattern
						+ Try with deque
						+ Try with old-style visit (step 9 below)
						+ Try following raster visit using per-plane indices in final vector
							+ 1: ConnectivityVisit: populate N+1 vector with # of triangles per plane
							+ 2: Triangles::Upload: take it and send endpoints to ShipRenderContext
							+ Test
							+ If ok:
								+ Add # of owned triangles to each point (new buffer)
									+ Init to 0 at Points::Add
									+ Update count at Points::Add/RemoveConnectedTriangles
									+ Use it @ ConnectivityVisit instead of counting triangles
				+ Undefine flood rendering
				+ See if need to and can make alpha threshold higher, to eliminate artifacts around ropes close to their endpoints on
				  Titanic's funnels
				+ Test texture mode
				+ Test structure mode
					+ See if loss of ropes over structure is ugly; if we can live without it, remove conditions and dual
					  rope rendering
				+ Test full RenderMode x DebugRenderMode matrix:
					+ Texture, ...
					+ Structure, ...
				+ Test stressed springs
				+ Commit
			+ Step 9: cleanup:
				+ ConnectivityVisit: redo visit from L to R and thus simplify ortho matrix
				+ Remove commented-out connectivity visit
				+ Commit
			+ Step 10: generic textures
				+ GenericTextures: is now own pass that uses own plane IDs as input for Z's in shader
					+ Upload plane IDs instead of conn comp IDs
						+ Fix at all calls from:
							+ Bombs
							+ Points::UploadEphemeralPoints
								+ The texture ones can now pass real plane ID, fix call chain up to caller
							+ PinnedPoint
					+ Fix grow problem at ShipRenderContext
					+ For now keep doing per-plane partitioning of textures for depth-sorting; we'll try alternatives later
					+ Pass PlaneID into gen tex shader (which must NOT take point's vertex attrib)
					+ Try without padding?
					+ That TODO for moving allocation of vertex buffer
						+ And rename of member: mGenericTextureRenderPolygonVertexAllocatedSize
				+ Test
					+ Gen textures are correctly covered by things (ropes, triangles, gen textures) in nearer plane,
					  and correctly cover things (ropes, triangles, gen textures) in further plane
					+ Test bombs - different planes
					+ Test pinned points - different planes
					+ Test eph particles - different planes
				+ Commit
			+ Step 11: vectors
				+ Add PlaneID to vectors
				+ Test & commit
			+ Step 12: ephemeral points
				+ EphemeralPoints: is now own pass that uses plane IDs as input for Z's in shader
				+ When eph particles are created (e.g. at Points::CreateEphemeralParticleDebris()), we write to the planeId buffer but
				  don't re-upload it; should mark plane ID buffer as dirty, but at two different segments, and then blindly
				  invoke UploadPlaneIdsIfDirty() from ship

			+ 7: Complete RenderContext Implementation (5)
				+ Reset: queued and waited (ShipRenderContext destructor does OpenGL)
				+ Screenshot: queued and waited, like SpringLab
				+ Destructor:
					+ Make sure thread member is first, so its destructor gets called first
					  waiting for pending operations
					+ Split off WorldRenderContext
							! RenderContext owns ShaderManager and WorldRenderContext and Ships and NotificationContext
							! WorldRenderContext has ShaderManager reference like Ship, and copies own
							  texture metadata (passed on by RenderContext via cctor)
							! WorldRenderContext exposes detailed init and upload and draw methods
						+ Initialization:
							+ Textures:
								+ Those textures that are exclusively for the world get moved
								  to WorldRenderContext (Clouds, world)
							+ RenderContext::cctor:
								+ Invoke both own and WorldRenderContext's initializations
							+ Make sure ambient light intensity gets calculated
							+ Make sure world border gets calculated
								+ Via WorldRenderContext::ProcessParameterChanges
							+ WorldRenderContext cctor also gets reference - and does own init'n - to:
								+ Generic textures
								+ mUploadedNoiseTexturesManager (like NotificationRenderContext below) for
								  setting noise textures as needed
						+ Hook all Upload() calls
						+ Hook all Render calls
						+ RenderContext::ApplyParamChanges:
							+ maintain those that affect two tools and generals
							+ invoke child contexts'
							+ Make sure world border gets calculated
								+ Via WorldRenderContext::ProcessParameterChanges
					+ Split off GlobalRenderContext for 2 generic textures, for explosion textures, for noise textures
						+ Pass then to child contexts as needed
					+ Move out 2 tools to NotificationRenderContext
						+ And do ProcessParameterChanges(.) on it
							+ And thus get rid of RenderContext::ApplyEffectiveAmbientLightIntensityChanges
						+ And have own initialization method, invoked after RenderContext::InitializeGenericTextures,
						  that does own part of RenderContext::InitializeGenericTextures, which takes
						  mUploadedNoiseTexturesManager for setting noise textures as needed
					+ Do correct destroy sequence

					+ if found: toggle it & add to stack & mark as dirty for re-upload & return true

			+ Move stack and mArePinnedPointsDirty back into ship, together with search logic
				+ Points gets back Pin() and Unpin()
				+ Ship::Destroy as well
			+ Pinned points are uploaded by decision of Ship
				+ Decision: if mAreElementsDirty || mArePinnedPointsDirty

	+ Bombs:
		+ Spec:
			+ Placed and removed with similar tool as Point Pinning
			+ Two types of bombs: timer and remote controlled
			+ A bomb explodes when:
				+ Its timer times out or the remote control is triggered
				+ The point it's attached to is destroyed
				+ A point or spring in the "neighborhood" (a separate, small radius) is destroyed (includes nearby explosion)
			+ When one or more bombs are detonated, ship needs to know only position, connected component ID, and blast radius,
			  not even point index
				+ Thus (exploded) bombs are independent from lifetime of point that they were attached to,
				  allowing ship to destroy point immediately at first step of detonation, for example
				  if we have multiple-step detonations
				+ By not using point index we allow explosions to affect multiple connected components (of same ship though)
			+ Bomb decides for itself when it's to be deleted, and Bombs consequently removes it from
			  collection (and from point indirectly via Bomb::Destroy which, if attached to point, calls Points::Detach)

		+ Impl:
			+ Final test
			+ TEST: bombs are attached to springs instead of points
				+ Move isAttached buffer from Points to Springs
				+ Move mass trick to springs
				+ Bomb position becomes positionA and positionB (bomb attached across)
					+ Also BlastHandler argument is positionA and positionB
					+ Blast calculated's by ship from middle point
				+ inline Springs::GetPointA/BPosition(Points const &)
				+ Points::SetMassToMaterial(float ~offset)
				+ Restructure positionA and positionB:
					+ Freeze position and rotation offset, not positionA and positionB
				+ Fix calculation of alpha - check just zero
			+ TEST: lead-in: continuate ping counter, just different velocity and different translation to frame index
			+ TEST: 360 rotation
			+ Fix mass augmentation
				+ Also update springs' coefficients
			+ Fix blast flipping
			+ TEST: run in debug
			+ FIX: first blast handler is so small that it doesn't find point in radius
				+ Go linearly from 0.6 to BlastRadius
				+ At end, re-enable texture frame for explosions
			+ FIX: ContinuousSound start while paused issue
				+ DesiredState
			+ FIX: TimerBomb x,y offsets
				+ Restore cursor hotspot
				+ Add temporarily fixed world offset at ShipRenderContext
					+ Desired center: 147, 228 off 300, 300 => +3, -78 over 12.0, 12.0 makes 0.12, -3.12

					+ Finalize GetArea(): decide if new enlarged explosion looks good
					+ NeighborhoodDisturbed()
						+ Equivalent to RCDetonate()
				+ TimerBomb:
					+ Update(): state machine
						+ Sparkles: sort frames by distance on fuse and do random choice on sliding window
						+ Add a base frame of bomb with no fuse
							+ Rename all frames
							+ Fix calculation of base frame count at Update()
						+ Smoke:
							+ 3 sequential frames
					+ NeighborhoodDisturbed()

			+ Plan:
				+ Media:
					+ Sound: continuous (3 choir tones)

		+ Spec:
			+ Deletes springs (and affected triangles) that cross the *path* of the tool
			+ Continuous sound, overwater and underwater, depending on where x,y is
		+ Impl:
			+ Media:

			+ Ship:
				+ Do EnumFlags class in EnumFlags.h
					+ Use it 2 X in Springs
				+ Make sure Spring::Destroy only deletes triangles that share one edge with the spring
					= Nuke Point::Breach and do everything instead in Ship's destroy handler, driven off
					  Springs::DestroyOptions
				+ Test whether should fire the Break event even if only springs are deleted
					+ For points we fire the event in the ship's PointDestroyHandler; if we
					  want to fire now from ship's SpringDestroyHandler, we must be told whether
					  the spring destruction comes from a point destruction or not: FromPointDestroy vs FromSpringDestroy
					  + If we do this, we can now also remove firing of break from within Springs::UpdateStrains,
					    as the ship's SpringDestroyHandler would be invoked with FromSpringDestroy
				+ Use Geometry::Segment::TestIntersect()
					+ Also add to it GetAngle...
						+ Move from Texture Rotation
					+ Move also AABB to Geometry
			+ SoundController: new continuous sound

		+ python script: allow empty cells (skip cols if != index)
			+ Make template more compact
		+ Regenerate template
		+ Re-check bomb weight
		+ Regenerate template
		+ If ok:
			+ Before unhack: fix ships:
				+ Do Masts and investigate mass effect on breakage
				+ Fix Titanic:
					+ Lighter rudder
					+ Also generally Lighter?
					+ Stronger under funnels (make tin stronger?)
					+ Make it break
						+ Study tension based off mass
							+ Solve integral manually
							+ Do tests
						+ Softer again under funnels
					+ Fix mast
					+ Glass breaks immediately
				+ Fix Base III: make it float

					+ See with thicker columns (make a new one and call it Base II)
				+ Fix default ship: just lighter

				+ Fix Krafting - no sudden stress
			+ Rewrite buoyancy code - use WaterMass
			+ Change materials
				+ No Mass but object with:

		+ Add to change list
	+ Fix buoyancy
		+ Maintain trick with which hull points don't feel buoyancy (or else wood hull would never sink)
		+ Adjust gravity force though

	+ Ephemeral Particles:
		+ Spec:
			+ Carve out fixed-size room at tail of Points for ephemeral particles
				+ Each has own lifetime
			+ Ephemeral particles cannot be deleted
			+ Rendering: via:
				+ ShipRenderContext::UploadEphemeralParticlePoints (e.g. for points)
					+ Just indexes
					+ Color/alpha portion of buffer has to be uploaded first
				+ ShipRenderContext::UploadGenericTexture (e.g. for bubbles)
					+ Need to also support alphaTransparency
			+ Ephemeral particles are drawn with own color, including alpha going to transparent as lifetime increases
				+ Test first perf impact of using vec4f for point colors
					+ If sucks a lot, will need new extra buffer just for points' alpha
						+ Also this buffer is segmented
				+ Ephemeral portion of entire points color buffer needs to be reloaded at each Upload()
				  or UploadEphemeralParticles() (2*)
					+ Use glSubBufferData
					+ If we go for separate alpha buffer: also do for ephemeral portion of alpha buffer
		+ Impl:
			+ Test vec4f for colors
				+ Points
				+ ShipBuilder
				+ RenderContext/ShipRenderContext
				+ Shaders
			+ Set max eph particles to 1024
			+ Points allocs extra room

					+ Buffer<EphemeralState> mEphemeralStateBuffer;

			+ Ship: limit point range:
				+ @ destroy tool, @ bombs explosions, and @ anything else that destroys point: do not destroy ephemeral points
				+ @ toggle bombs: do not attach to ephemeral points
				+ For all of these: use Points::NonEphemeralPoints iterator, or check EphemeralType != None, depending on the case

			+ Points::CreateEphemeralParticleDebris:
				+ Args:
					+ Position, Velocity
					+ MaxLifetime
					+ Material *
						+ Requires MaterialDatabase to be handy at invoker of CreateEphemeralParticleDebris
							+ Ship must take a DB by value at cctor
						+ Though Debris uses spring's material
				+ Impl:
					+ Find first expired particle; if not found, pick the oldest
						+ Requires mFreeEphemeralParticleSearchStartIndex
						+ In private ElementIndex FindFreeEphemeralParticle()
							+ sets mFreeEphemeralParticleSearchStartIndex
					+ Store Color, Position, Velocity
					+ Store Mass
					+ Do any other initializations that we do at Points::Add(...)
					+ Store MaxLifetime, and zero lifetime
					+ Set mAreEphemeralParticlesDirty = true

			+ Points::UpdateEphemeralParticles(clockNow):
				+ For each point, check lifetime vs max lifetime
				+ If time has expired (now):
					+ No need to mark as deleted to hide them, EphemeralType==None suffices to prevent them from being rendered
					+ Reset velocity and integration factor of expired particles to avoid drifting
						+ Rename Points::Pin/Unpin() to Freeze/Thaw()
					+ Set EphemeralType to None
					+ Set mAreEphemeralParticlesDirty = true
				+ Else: do per-type state machine, with dispatch coded in method depending on type, invoking
				  per-type state machine method; for example:
					+ Those that are points:
						+ Calc remaining life
						+ Update alpha either in (portion of) color buffer or in (portion of) alpha buffer
					+ Those that are textures:
						+ Calc remaining life

			+ Points::UploadEphemeralParticles():
				+ 1) Upload portion of color buffer/alpha buffer specific to ephemeral particles
				+ 2) If mAreEphemeralParticlesDirty:
					+ RenderContext::EphemeralPointUploadStart()
				+ 3) For all ephemeral points with EphemeralType != None: use dispatch coded in method depending on type, invoking
				     per-type upload method; for example:
					+ Those that are points:
						+ Add point index to a buffer
					+ Those that are textures:
						+ Call directly ShipRenderContext::UploadGenericTexture(...)
				+ 4) If mAreEphemeralParticlesDirty:
					+ RenderContext::EphemeralPointUploadEnd()
					+ Set mAreEphemeralParticlesDirty = false

			+ Ship::UpdateEphemeralParticles(clockNow):
				+ Calls Points::UpdateEphemeralParticles(clockNow)
				+ Emits ephemeral particles from emitters (e.g. smoke)
					+ For now empty
		+ Cleanup:
			+ See if can control debris generation via GameParameters, which must be made available at
			  Ship::SpringDestroyHandler
		+ Tests:

			+ Many connected components
	+ Do debris each time a spring breaks
		+ Look'n'feel:
			+ Points of the color of the spring's material
				+ Actually, points of the spring's material
		+ At Ship::SpringDestroyHandler()
			+ Choose 0, 1, or 2 debris // Experiment
			+ For each:
				+ Material = spring's material
				+ Position = midpoint of spring
				+ Velocity = point on circle as:
					+ Radius: random in [1, 5] // Experiment
					+ Angle: random in [0, 2PI]
				+ MaxLifetime = from GameParameters static const, plus random factor in [0.5-1.0]
		+ Debris:
			+ Update:
				+ Update color's alpha based off remaining lifetime, linear
			+ Upload:
				+ Just store index in buffer

		+ Test look'n'feel and finalize constants
	+ Ocean depth bitmaps
		+ OceanFloor cctor takes ResourceLoader
		+ ResourceLoader used by ocean floor to load image
		+ OceanFloor translates image into float[] with raw pixel y's
		+ At update, raw pixel y's are normalized/enhanced with new GameParameters constant
		+ Test
	+ Slider for "simulation quality", affecting num of mechanical simulation iterations
		+ Update GameParameters - Points and Springs might have to recalc things on changes
			+ Ship
			+ Points
			+ Springs
		+ Fix: invoke points.updategameparams
		+ SettingsDialog: under mechanics tab
		+ Requires extended status text w/measurements
		+ See what to do with stiffness setting: max 1.0f? Leave it
	+ Fix ephemeral particles
		+ Pass also "now" all over the place
			+ End put back UpdateEphemeralParticles where it was
		+ Just single vector of PointIndex, no connected components
		+ Make ephemeral particles' update based on simulation clock, not wall clock
			+ "now" passed everywhere really has to become a "simulationNow" float
		+ Test
		+ Finalize constants
	+ Do chainsaw sparkles with Ephemeral Particles
		+ At Ship::Chainsaw for each broken spring
		+ Initial particle dynamics:
			+ Position: midpoint of spring
			+ Velocity: radial vector:
				+ Butterfly perpendicular to *direction of sawing*, not spring
				+ Magnitude: uniformly random in range
			+ Number: per Update step: uniform random centered around SparkleDensity (ratio over 10, initially) (from GameParameters, adjustable)
			+ Color:
				+ Metal: brightest red to bright red
				+ Else: base material's render color
			+ Finalize parameters
			+ Final test
	+ Add cloth material
		+ Test, basically rope-like but no rope
			+ Low stiffness, hight strength
		+ If fine:
			+ Make it for all basic colors
			+ Structural Template:
				+ Cloth and Rope on same row
				- Redo
			+ Cloth sound
			+ Make ship with Dutch and Italian flags
	+ Buoyancy rearc
		+ Double-fix for rope/buoyancy/hull unhack and fast-falling wet rope/cloth
		+ First of all, test with Integrate taking into account max(water, 1.0) for mass
			+ At integrate
			+ At spring relaxation, for spring masses
				+ NOPE: here it hurts; wet springs really don't break at all
			+ Check reality-ness
				+ Problem: ship sinks very slowly
					+ Due to: mp>>Mw: v=g*dt; mp<<Mw: v=0
		+ Introduce volumetric fill: fraction of 1m3 that is filled by material
			+ Also: fraction of 1m3 that may be filled with water
			+ Also: volume of displaced water
			+ Default: 1.0
			+ Explicitly set to low value at:
				+ Rope, Cloth
				+ All Hull's (zero)
			+ Remove Points::Buoyancy
			+ Use volumetric fill at:
				+ UpdatePointForces()
				+ Integrate() (temporarily - becomes IntegrationFactor again, but re-calc'd explicitly at each step)

		+ Reintroduce water absorption
			+ High absorption at ropes and cloth
			+ Points buffer
			+ Use it at UpdateWaterIntake

		+ Test look'n'feel
			+ Test for less bouncy crashes: springs using wet mass, again
				+ No, worse
			+ Existing ships
				+ Pay attention to crashes onto sea floor
			+ Rope
				+ WaterRestitution
				+ Fast-falling-when-wet bug
				+ Buoyancy/sinking
			+ Cloth
				+ WaterRestitution
				+ Fast-falling-when-wet bug

		+ Now, optimize:
			+ Points::UpdateTotalMass(): calculates:
				+ (New) IntegrationFactor (vec2)
				+ TotalMass (for UpdatePointForces())
			+ Invoke at Ship::UpdateMechanicalDynamics before all
			+ Then, undo changes at Integrate()
			+ Then, use new quantities at UpdatePointForces()
			+ Test:
				+ Changes to Simulation Quality are picked up
				+ Bombs' extra mass

		+ Cleanup TODO's at Ship (SpringForces attempt)
		+ Points::UploadForceBuffer: decide length
		+ Update materials.md docs with new properties, including water
		+ Update ShipAnalyzer for correct buoyancy-adjusted mass
	+ Improve light diffusion
		+ Use real distance
		+ No more non-linear behavior

	+ Add "Low-Dimmed Lights" and "Medium-", and "Portholes"
		+ New Electrical Property of Lamp ("Luminescence") at ElectricalMaterial
		+ New Lamp property at ElectricalElements
			+ Consumed by DiffuseLight
		+ Use at Queen of Unova
	+ Wind and cloth
		+ Step 1: Points has WindReceptivity buffer, for now set at Add(.) to 1.0 if material is one of cloth
		+ UpdatePointForces:
			+ Add wind force vector to overwater points, multiplied by WindReceptivity
				+ From mParentWorld.GetCurrentWindForce()
					+ Step 1: GameParameters.WindDirection * GameParameters.WindSpeed
					+ Will become erratic later on
		+ Test with new flag (Iceland) attached to FlagShip
		+ Step 2: new StructuralMaterial property: WindReceptivity
			+ Optional in json (default=0.0), only set for cloth
			+ Update guide
		+ Step 3: erratic behavior of wind
			+ GameParameters::WindSpeed becomes WindSpeedBase
			+ World::UpdateWind(): implements state machine and calcs current wind force
				+ Incorporate gust adjustment
				+ See if we need to up force a bit for fater response
					+ See first w/64 fps first if more respondent - skinnier test ship
				+ Use short running average to smooth transitions (minimally)
					+ Make it 4
					+ Get rid of intermediate states
				+ Do piecewise state machine, w/various prob types
					+ Gust transitions are still poisson, but not their duration
		+ Step 4:
			+ See interaction of wind on waves
				+ Hi-freq sine whose amplitude is normally zero unless wind force over base
		+ Add all wind settings to SettingsDialog
			+ Include global flag
		+ Sound:
			+ Layered like waves:
				+ 1 continuous sound
					+ Triggered by abs threshold, 30
				+ 1 one-shot sound (Gust)
					+ Triggered by abs threshold && force > .9*Max
			+ IEventHandlers::OnWindForce...(zero, base, max)
			+ Do more gusts
			+ Fix initial ramp up
				+ RunningAverage::Fill(float)
				+ Remove log message @ SoundController
			+ Remove probe
			+ Make sound's volume change inertial
		+ Add probe for wind force
		+ Step 5: implications of low wind settings
		+ Test:
			+ SettingsDialog:
				+ Dealing with negative wind
					+ See ripples

		+ Check with wind speed = 0 - divisions by zero!
			+ Wind

			+ Sound?
		+ Test another re-dimension:
			+ Fw = 1/2 rho v2 A
		+ Test perf
			+ Do perf analysis to rule out sound
		+ Rearc: Wind exports speed (vector & magnitudes), in km/h
			+ Ship calcs force
			+ Calc & adjust sound factors
			+ Test:
				+ Force on cloth
					+ Lower receptivity
				+ Force on Titanic's cables
				+ Sound
					+ Lower curve
				+ Waves
					+ Make them faster
				+ Clouds
				+ Max settings
		+ Cloth:

	+ Decay (rust)

			+ GameParameters: DecayAcceler8r controls how quickly

			+ Low-frequency Ship update does job
		+ Impl:

					+ Idea is that Ship::DecayStructure sends it asymptotically to 0.0
			+ Springs: new MaterialStrength float buffer
				+ Init with material strength, same as Strength
				+ Getter const
			+ Points: ConnectedSprings structure contains size_t with # of springs owned by the point

	+ Heat and Combustion
		+ Spec:
			+ Integration of Decay with Combustion:
				+ Combustion also is a source of decay
				+ Springs should get weak based off decay, independently from source
				+ It is really 3 distinct processes:
					+ 1a: Point rotting:
						+ Low-frequency
						+ water + isLeaking => decay
					+ 1b: Point combustion:
						+ Any frequency (combustion state machine update frequency)
						+ combustion y/n => decay
					+ 2: Spring decay
						+ Low-frequency
						+ p.decay => s.strength
							+ Use both endpoints' decay
						+ Impl:
							+ Springs::Decay(Points const &)
								+ For each spring: strength = material's strength * avg of two endpoints' decay
									+ float buffer: MaterialStrength
			+ Rendering of flames:
				+ Need depth-sorting:
					+ Ship has heap of indices of burning points
						+ Ordering of heap: plane ID
						+ Heap created from scratch at connectivity visit
						+ Heap updated by Points's combustion state machine update (heap passed by Ship) when points start
						  or stop burning
						+ Heap used by Points's Upload() (heap passed by Ship)
		+ Impl:
			+ Properties and Materials:
				+ New StructuralMaterial properties:
						+ Ignition temperature (T)
						+ Melting temperature (T)
						+ Thermal conductivity
						+ Specific Heat
						+ Combustion type (Combustion, Explosion)
					+ Add all of them via script, with switches based off material type
						+ Thermal conductivity: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity#Units
						+ Then, manual tune
					+ Add all of them to guide
				+ Points:
					+ MaterialIgnitionTemperature
					+ Temperature/Buffer
					+ CombustionState/Buffer
				+ Springs:
					+ MaterialMeltingTemperature (avg of two endpoints, calcd at Add())
					+ MaterialThermalConductivity (avg of two endpoints, calcd at Add())
				+ Renames:
					+ Points::TotalMass -> "CurrentMass" (and UpdateTotalMasses)
						+ TODO: rethink this one; "Mass" contains augmentation nowadays
					+ Springs::Stiffness -> "MaterialStiffness"

			+ Heat overlay:
				+ Ship/RenderContext flag
				+ SettingsDialog
				+ Ship::Render: when flag set, upload heat buffer (much like we do w/Decay)
					+ Ship/RenderContext UploadHeat
						+ Maintains dirty flag and exposes MarkTempBufAsDirty - exactly like decay - which is invoked by:
							+ Heat propagation
				+ Ship/RenderContext render
					+ Rendering:

							+ Do second, richer version of main ones - "...WithTemperature..." - that completely
							  replace the first ones when the heat overlay is activated
								+ Texture
								+ Color
							+ Parameter setting
						+ Use temperature buffer (of floats) to produce "temperature color" as:
							+ tint3 = mix(c1, c2, some f of temperature ~= 1-e^(-paramHeatContrast*T)) // see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescence#/media/File:Example_incandescence_colors_(temperature_range_550_-_1300_C).svg
						+ Make it glow in the night
						+ Use function (in include) to apply heat overlay
							+ Nuke static params 4 colors
						+ Try multi-band gradient
					+ Transparency at SettingsDialog
						+ "Render" section under "Heat"
						+ Figure out right default value
			+ Physics update:
				+ Ship::Update:
					+ @Beginning: either call Springs::UpdateParameters(params, points) or call
					  Springs::UpdateDecayAndTemperatureAndParameters(params, points), depending on simulation step
						+ Springs::UpdateParameters(params, points):
							+ iff params updated: UpdateDecayAndTemperatureAndParameters(params, points)
						+ Test:
							+ Stress and break (Titanic)
							+ Mass augmentation
							+ Repair (restore)
							+ Param changes
						+ Springs::UpdateDecayAndTemperatureAndParameters(params, points):
							+ Assumption: Decay and Temperature have changed (Parameters not necessarily)
							+ (Params, P.Temperature, P.Mass) -> StiffnessCoefficient
							+ (Params, P.Mass) -> DampingCoefficient
							+ (Params, P.Decay, P.Temperature) -> S.Strength
								+ Params are needed to include StrengthAdjustment and NumMechanicalDynamicsIterationsAdjustment
								  in "current" strength
								+ Add "MaterialStrength", and use "Strength" for strain
									+ Check for all current uses of Strength and replace with MaterialStrength
								+ Since we're touching this: factor in Strength the other things that we calculate at
								  UpdateStrains, namely:
									+ StrengthAdjustment, NumMechanicalDynamicsIterationsAdjustment
									+ Rest Length
							+ Flip burning and melting point in metals
						+ Nuke Ship::DecaySprings and, with it, Springs::Set(Current)Strength
						+ Cleanup low-frequency schedule now that DecaySprings is gone
							+ Change frequency altogether to 7*6
						+ Verify assembly: hopefully no call to UpdateForDTP(...springIndex...) from UpdateForDTP(all)
					+ Later on: Ship::UpdateHeatDynamics:
						+ At one slot: call Ship::PropagateHeat()
							+ Propagation and dissipation
								+ New global constants: AirTemperature, WaterTemperature
								+ Use specific dt's calc's as constexpr's in UpdateTemperature based off frequency of steps
								+ Dissipation: use air or water temp, depending on whether it's above water or below
									+ Exaggerate water dissipation, so that smothered fire does not rekindle immediately
										+ First, double-check calculations, however
							+ Cleanup TODO's (and do we have a useless step frequency constant now?) to keep it at each step
						+ At another slot: call Points::UpdateCombustionStateMachineLowFrequency(...)
							+ For each point:
								+ If it's not combusting:
									+ Check combustion transition
										+ Notify
										+ Choose random max development
								+ Else (it's combusting):
									+ Check exhaustion transition
										+ Notify (boolean for water-caused)
									+ Do decay: burn rate (i.e. decay speed) ~= structural mass (the lower the mass, the faster decays)
										+ Verify default, min, and max
									+ No temperature and no raise and lower flames, done below at Points::UpdateCombustingPoints()
								+ Water (both underwater and flood) should apply regardless of state
								+ Do phased ignitions (N at a time)
									+ Run low-frequency state machine M times for 1/Mth of the points each time
									+ Choose number of promoted randomly = N
										+ Find right N: depends on M
									+ At each step: choose top N ignitions over all candidates, sorted
									  by temperature over ignition temperature
						+ At all steps: call Points::UpdateCombustionStateMachineHighFrequency(heap)
							+ Points uses heap (with burning points) and evolves the "burning"
							  state machine
								+ Raise flames up and down
									+ Redo 3 curves, see paper
								+ Heat to self and neighbors
									+ Do code changes
									+ Do flag to turn off flame rendering
										+ Move flame rendering to heat & combustion?
			+ Ship::ConnectivityVisit:
				+ Call Points::ReorderBurningPoints()
			+ Ship::Render:
				+ Calls Points::UploadFlames()
					+ Uploads flames in order of heap
			+ See Pac0master's bug: looks like when the cardboard of the funnel touches the water it starts generating a super high amount of heat
			+ See Pac0master's bug: Spawn the default ship,  max out the Thermal conductivity and  dissipation the back of the ship will start to heat up and melt very fast
			+ Melting improvements:
				+ Option 1: Test with sticky strength
					+ Springs has new buffer, "MeltStrengthComponent", always > 1.0
					+ We might also need sticky stiffness, but try with strength first
				+ Option 2: Test with sticky rest length
					+ StiffnessCoeff and Strength are memory-less: they return to their original values when no melting occurs,
					  but RestLength not
					+ First test in-place modifying RestLength; if ok:
						+ Make "FactoryRestLength" buffer
						+ Verify all usages of RestLength and choose accordingly
							+ Repair: try using both as targets and choose best
						+ Decide performant way of making rest length sticky
						+ Update comments at Springs
					+ Do asymptotic stiffness, not zero
					+ Try different DeltaTMax's
					+ Repair: recalc coeffs when we've set a new rest length
						+ Adjust rest length before all, "snapping" rest length to factory when close enough
							+ Also set rest length to factory when spring restored
						+ Use boolean flag to recalc coeffs just once per spring
						+ General:
							+ See if should be faster (play with settings' speed)
							+ See if UltraViolent mode makes sense
						+ Decide whether to target current or factory rest length
			+ Electrical: devices generate heat, and lights and generators break at low and high temperatures
				+ New electrical material properties - "HeatGenerated" and operating temperatures
				+ GameParameters: electrical heat generated adjustment
					+ Settings dialog: new "Electrical" section between HeatBlaster and World
				+ Rearc:
					+ ElectricalElements has buffer with operating temperatures
					+ ElectricalElements::UpdateSourcesAndPropagation (rename from "Connectivity")
						+ Move from Ship
						+ Uses mSourceIndices as starting point, instead of just generators
							+ Nuke generator indices
						+ For each source:
							+ Check preconditions:
								+ Wetness
								+ Operating temperature
							+ If ok:
								+ Generate heat (using also adjustment)
								+ Flood graph for VisitSequenceNumber
					+ Rename "AvailableCurrent" as "AvailableLight"
					+ ElectricalElements::UpdateSinks (replaces "Update")
						+ Uses mSinkIndices (vector of indices, not only lamps)
						+ Lamps: run lamp state machine
							+ Consider also operating temperatures in state machine and transition accordingly
							+ Each time AvailableLight is > 0, generate heat (using also adjustment)
					+ Make self-combusting ship:
						+ Make heat-resistant materials (low thermal conductivity and high heat capacity):
							+ Electrical:
								+ Generator
								+ Lamp
								+ Heating Element
									+ And catch at script
						+ Do ship
						+ Redo template
			+ Make flames smaller when point is orphaned
				+ 1: Ship::SpringDestroyHandler: invoke Ship::OnPointOrphaned for each endpoint that becomes orphaned

				+ Reduce local coherency of noise
					+ Add FlamePersonalitySeed shader param, straight from ship into vertex buffer
				+ Make same colors as flamethrower
				+ Adjust bottom

						+ Assign actual random number between zero and one at ignition time
						+ Change shader to expect value between zero and one
					+ Try dual-phase rendering: border only first, body only then
						+ Test
						+ Do vertex includes
						+ Test perf with instanced drawing(x2)
				+ See if can fix problem with flames on ropes that swing behind triangles
					+ Separate render step for chains, and flames belong to chains if their point
					  has no attached triangles
					+ Test
					+ If works:
						+ Go back to one single buffer (& single VBO, & single VAO), having StartUpload declare total # of flames,
						  and adding bg ones at beginning and fg ones at end
							+ Keep track of beginning of fg ones == end of bg ones
					+ OnChain detection: use # of factory triangles, not current triangles (heuristic to avoid jumping planes

					+ Subscribe to OnCombustionSmothered: play one-time sizzling
		+ Experiments/Improvements:
			+ Consider higher default heat from flamethrower tool
				+ Current (900k) is fine for wood and ropes and cloth
			+ Fire-generated heat should be 10x in order to spread more
				+ Or: check if heat should depend on ignition temperature of that point
					+ Is it possible that the heat we release now from burning hi-ign-temp points is actually lower than the one
					  the point has in order to be at that temperature?
				+ Spreads just fine on wood, ropes, and cloth
			+ Lower the min decay for extinguishing, so things break easier once burnt
			+ When state is Burning, also decay non-burning neighbors on top of decaying self (so to smear burnt color more around)
				+ At low-frequency update
			+ Max flame development depends on number of springs connected to point (so ropes have smaller flames)
			+ See if heating element should heat less
			+ Try max air and water temp to 5K
			+ Make melted stuff break earlier
				+ Limit breaking length somehow
				+ Try with limiting rest length instead
				+ Avoid breaking: try with non-smoothstep melt depth (and lower breaking length when melted)
			+ Flame render:
				+ Move more with wind
				+ Transparency on border - slightly more transparent at discard threshold
				+ Noise sampling tests, who knows - it might get better:
					+ Try different noise resolution
					+ Try without second noise component
					+ Try with third noise component
			+ Flamethrower flame render:
				+ Large flamethrower should have higher resolution
				+ Softer border
		+ Optimizations:

	+ Switches:
		! Spec:
			! Two new electrical material types:
				! Interactive switch
					! Controlled by user
				! Water sensing switch
					! Controlled by water
			! Color trick like ropes to have unique and deterministic IDs for switches
				! One material (base structural color) for initially on and another one for initially off
					! Property: conducts_eletricity, just sets the default value
			! New electrical property: ConductsElectricity, bool - used at connectivity visit
				! Lights, Cables, Generators have it as true (also in ElectricalMaterial and in json)
				! Switches have it as true or false depending on whether switch is "on" or "off"
					! The act of switching ("Toggle...()") toggles the boolean
		+ Electrical materials:
			+ Two new types:
				+ GameType enum
				+ Interactive switch
					! Controlled by user
				+ Water sensing switch
					! Controlled by water
			+ New electrical property: ConductsElectricity, bool - used at connectivity visit
				+ Lights, Cables, Generators have it as true (also in ElectricalMaterial and in json)
				+ Switches have it as true or false depending on whether switch is "on" or "off"
		+ GameTypes:
			+ ObjectId overhaul:
				+ ObjectId is unique only in the context in which it's used (e.g. bombs vs switches)
				+ ObjectId == <ShipId (new GameType alias, uint32_t w/ None), LocalObjectId (uint32_t)>
					+ LocalObjectId is provided by caller
					+ ObjectIdGenerator only provides helper for globally unique - with no guarantees - or should go
				+ All ship ID ints become ShipId
				+ All object ID ints become ObjectId
			+ LocalSwitchId typedef (uint32_t)
			+ SwitchId == ObjectId<LocalSwitchId>
			+ SwitchState enum (mapped to bool)
		+ Ship json adds optional names for each ID
			+ as vector<std::string>
		+ ShipBuilder detects all switches as electrical elements
			+ Instance ID is from color code
			+ Checks for duplicate instance IDs - errors out if duplicate found
			+ Instance ID is only used to match with ship's switch names from json (or to make default label when no label specified),
			  then each switch gets name as part of Electrical Elements data communicated to ship
				+ If label not present -> "Switch <instance ID>"
				+ ElectricalElements::Add now also takes std::string label
				+ ObjectId is implicit and not specified now (local ID is index in container of switches's ElementIndex within ElectricalElements)
		+ Electrical dynamics:
			+ ElectricalElement has new "conductsElectricity" buffer
				+ ~ Material (init'd with material's) and "current", in same struct (~ double "Switch")
				+ cctor: value of material's x 2
				! ElectricalElements::UpdateSourcesAndPropagation automagically considers it as it is now in the connectivity graph
			+ GC->World->Ship->ElectricalElements::SetSwitchState(SwitchId, SwitchState)

			+ mConductingConnectedElectricalElementsBuffer:

				+ Power (in HP)
				+ Responsiveness
				+ Engine Type:
					+ Steam
			+ Different json materials
				+ Use actual HP, not newtons
				+ Outboard
					+ Sound type
					+ Mount on LifeBoat
				+ One more powerful LR steam engine
			+ Store responsiveness and power in EngineState at ElectricalElements::Add

	+ Pumps
		! Spec:
			! New electrical element type
			! Two types: "in" or "out"
			! Pumps' intake is superimposed to leaking point's intake
				! Point that pump is attached to may or may not be hull, and may or may not be leaking; regardless, when powered,
				  water is sucked in our out
			! Water is taken @ Ship::UpdateWaterIntake()
				! In: as long as external water pressure > 0
				! Out: as long as internal water pressure > 0
			! Continuous sound when pumping
		+ Impl:

				+ Add(): store as sink
				+ UpdateSinks():
					+ Move IsDeleted check for each type down to its case
						+ See if due to this, we can now put back anything in switch
					+ Pump type:
						+ 1) if ! Deleted: do operating state machine (connectivity, operating temperature) to come up

							+ @ power state changes: emit highlight
						+ 2) smooth CurrentForce towards TargetForce and set Points::LeakComposite::WaterPumpForce

	+ Flood doors (*) - really "Powered watertight doors"
		! Spec:
			! New electrical element
			! Point that flood door is attached to may or may not be hull
			! When powered, inverts hullness of point, and water permeability of all attached springs
			! Plays one-shot sound @ when open or closed - much like TimerBomb's defuse
				! No ObjectID needed thus
				! Open sound X n1, Close sound X n2
		+ Impl:
			+ Prep:
				+ Springs::Add() knows nothing about hullness
					+ WaterPermeability set to 1.0
					+ Get rid of Springs::Characteristics::Hull
					+ Replace Springs::Characteristics with simple bool IsRope buffer
					+ Get rid of Springs::Characteristics
				+ Make sure there's no current Points::IsHull
				+ Add Points::IsHull (w/own bool buffer, Get(), and Set()), which will contain externally-computed resultant of
				  flood doors + material
					+ Default @ Points:Add(): from material
				+ Change Points::MaterialIsHull usages:
					+ @ Points::OnDamage: to decide whether or not to make the point leaking
						+ Target: use material's IsHull (kinda arbitrarily)
					+ @ ShipInteractions::Flood: to avoid flooding hull points
						+ Target: use new IsHull (to avoid flooding points on activated doors)
				+ Nuke MaterialIsHullBuffer as usages may directly check StructuralMaterial
			+ Ship::SetAndPropagateResultantPointHullness(pointIndex, bool isHull)
				+ Change Point::Hull and change Spring's::WaterPermeability according to old code:
					// The spring is hull if at least one node is hull
					// (we don't propagate water along a hull spring)
					if (points.GetMaterialIsHull(pointIndexRemap[springInfos2[s].PointAIndex1])

				+ Event response (size => volume)
					+ object-agnostic
			+ No real need to also change Point::Buoyancy
			+ No real need to also change Point::IsHull

					3	2	1
				+ For each scan line:
					+ For each flip point (0->1 or 1->0) from left p0 such that p0 does not belong to any frontiers:
						- fId = new frontier ID
						- p = p0; k = 4|0 (depending on flip type)
						- do:
							- Find p' from k+1 to k-1 (CW, %8)
								- If not found: it's an isolated point, go to next flip
							- Lookup <p, p'> in edge map
								- edge map is a purpose-built map, with <p, p'> being a lexicographically ordered key
								- assert is found, unless this is a "pure spring"
							- Make edge belong to frontier fId
							- if p' == p0: break
						- continue to next flip point on same scan line
				+ Fix bug
				+ Tests:
					+ Scan line finds first a chain point, then a triangle
					+ Scan line ends on a triangle vertex followed by a chain point
				+ Cleanup
					+ Remove unused args
				+ Remove ContainsEndpoints are replace with edge map earlier on
					+ EdgeMap gets added to each time we add to springInfos1
				+ Add timings for whole ShipBuilding and for FrontierBuilding alone

				+ Shader
				+ Adjust color shift speed w/release build
				+ Do color march differently - by playing with local progress:
				+ Move SettingsDialog checkbox to Debug rendering settings
			+ Maintenance at destroy:
				+ Ship's triangle destroy handler invokes new Frontier::HandleTriangleDestroy
				+ Marks mIsDirtyForRendering
				+ Triangles: points A,B,C indices also (mainly) avail as array

							+ Different frontier ID
							+ Fix bug wrt "traverse springs"
								+ See implications of not populating traverse springs; check all uses of:

									+ Triangles::SubSprings
				+ Things to remember:
					+ Every frontier that is changed/created is also flagged as dirty (new flag at Frontier)
					+ Each time we change an edge's frontier ID, also make sure we don't screw head - so set it there anyway
				+ Tests:
					+ Thanos' Snap
					+ 1 triangle with 3 lobes
			+ See if it makes sense to clear and restore Triangles' SubSprings - might just leave FactorySubSprings?
				+ If so, do like endpoints (3-array, etc.), respecting CW order
				+ Get rid of Frontiers::Triangles::Edges
				+ Test:
					+ Destroy
					+ Repair (without frontier maintenance)
			+ Maintenance at repair:
				+ Ship's triangle restore handler invokes new Frontier::HandleTriangleRestore
				+ Preliminary work:
					+ Cusp search needs to be done by searching triangles or edges connected to cusp Point
						+ Make do with existing structures @ Springs that track octants
				+ Cases:
					+ Case 3 frontiers
					+ Case 2 frontiers
					+ Case 0/1 frontiers
						+ Propagate 1 frontier
						+ Process cusps
							+ Ext1 != Ext2
							+ Ext1 == Ext2
						+ Handle pathological isolated triangle case
				+ Things to remember:
					+ Marks mIsDirtyForRendering
					+ Each time we change an edge's frontier ID, also make sure we don't screw head - so set it there anyway
		+ Optimizations:
			+ Frontiers::RegeneratePointColors(): only for frontiers marked as dirtyForRendering

	+ Directional water drag (*)
		! After frontier work
		! Separate into friction and pressure drags: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient#Concept
		+ Calc force depending on projection of particle's velocity along normal
			+ Try to re-instate square velocity drag
				! Two water drags:
					+ Point-based == friction drag
					+ Surface-based == pressure drag
				+ Split water drag adjustments
				+ Find right coefficients for both
				+ Need to clamp pressure force
					+ So better done after spring/nonspring forces rearc, so expense is minimized		
				+ Test Titanic Before and After
			+ Add new test shape: long
			+ See if should do back-pressure as well
				+ See gliding deifference between with-and without-back-pressure
					+ It does make a difference
				+ Do it right				
			+ See if should halve/lower pressure drag
			+ See if friction drag is needed after all
				+ Useful for impact
			+ Global drag change below
			+ Cloth explosion issue:
				+ Magnitude investigation:
					+ Default ship: max drag force mag=236,799
					+ Cloth: max force=18,910,600
				+ Issue is due to cloth's small mass, which makes force generate an enormous acceleration
					+ Try with linear force
			+ Weaker titanic bottom
				+ Copy to TitanicWithPower
			+ Water drag adjustments:
				+ Allow zero for both
				+ Maximum for friction
					+ Frictional: see below, lava
					+ Adjust if needed to avoid instabilities
				+ Maximum for pressure
					+ Adjust if needed to avoid instabilities					
			+ Final tests/Goals:
				+ Titanic
					+ Breakup
					+ Stern should glide				
				+ Lifeboat running fast and capsizing
				+ Hydrodynamics test
				X Ship falling from sky should break upon impact with water				
				+ Lava settings
					+ See if need to change drag adjustment setting name
				+ Submarine 3000 with anti-matter bomb on tail
			+ Incorporate water density in  drag
				+ pressure
				+ check lava again
			+ Cleanup force rendering x 3
		+ Video
			+ Side-by-side
			+ Titanic, possibly 2X
			+ "A glimpse of hydrodynamics"
		+ Changelist
			+ Also add "recalibrated all drag forces"
	+ See if we still need the high global damp - it affects the parabole traveled by slinged ships, they fall vertically at the end
		+ See with adj==0.5
			+ See if splinter springs dance for too long
			+ If ok: recalc everything so that world feels like with adj==0.5

			+ Basic AI:
				+ Initial placement
				+ Initial state (goal location, state)
				+ Basic state machine
			+ Tail rendering
				+ Progress:
					+ State stores CurrentProgressPhase
					+ Update adds to CurrentProgressPhase and calcs and stores CurrentProgress
				+ Upload progress as "tail" progress
					+ Rename as "TailProgress", also in shader
				+ Shader
					+ Also upload texture coords X boundaries for clamping
			+ Try with third bream, then decide which between first and third to keep
				+ Nuke other psd's, only keep chosen one
			+ Clamp spawning Y
			+ Final state machine:
				+ Fish turning around: simply done with geometry @ Upload
					+ Replace verticalSign with horizontalScale (between -1.0 and 1.0)
						+ Angles and flipping
				+ Round corners
					+ Replace state machine's CurrentPos & TargetPos with CurrentPos & CurrentVelocity (vector),
					  with velocity vector's y component used to update current pos, flattening depending on distance from StartPos or TargetPos
				+ Misc:
					+ Make CruiseSteering an optional<struct> & populate w/emplace
					+ Rename CalculateVelocity as MakeBasalVelocity
					+ See if may make auto-smoothing converge rate variable
					+ Rename fish.Direction as RenderVector
					+ Smooth direction and/or velocity vector constantly towards target
						+ When not in any "Steering" state
						+ See it might actually replace the "Steering without turning" state
					+ Need gravity state machine?
						+ bool IsInFreeFall
						+ In fall:
							+ Water drag inverse
							+ Immediate convergence of direction
						+ High- and Low-watermarks for ocean level, for enter/exit state checks
						+ End of fall: enter panic mode, keeping current (target) velocity; un-panic will do the rest and re-direct towards previous target position
					+ Allow fish in much panic to go out of water
						+ Simply don't consider water surface collision if panic > threshold
						+ Need freefall to allow for initial velocity with y > 0
					+ See whether we still need 2 water surface regimens
						! Confirmed: we hit BigPanic upon freefall re-entry
						+ Might get rid of "panic" one, as long as we don't hit the other one upon freefall re-entry
					+ See texture X coords limits issue
						+ See if it's due to not mipmapping upload
					+ Test freefall after wave
					+ Try with velocity brake @ re-entry being smoothened - with right (high) convergence rate
					+ At beginning of freefall, render direction change is too abrupt: try with auto-smoothing instead of immediate convergence
					+ See center of disturbance issue w/Mako
					+ Higher jump out of water
						+ Try lowering gravity amplification
						+ Try higher watermark for going out of water
					+ Waves at leave & re-entry
					+ Add tail speed and swing width to species
					+ Disturbance (& food): incorporate somehow fish quad size
						+ Move anchor point to species DB
						+ Need to know actual rendered size (texture world scaling factor * render adjust)
							+ FishSizeAdjust in GameParameters
								+ ...and stored by Fishes at Update()
							+ World size in species
								+ Not in Texture DB
								+ Also adjust tailX to be over whole length rather than just half
							+ Fishes passes world size to Render::Upload(.)
						+ FishSizeAdjust:
							+ SettingsDialog
							+ Finalize min & max values
							+ Parameter smoother
					+ Fix bug with fish count increasing
						+ Also make sure everything's fine after reducing & re-augmenting
					+ Test rendering ocean transparency, ambient light

						+ Fix size and frozen tail
							+ Redo shader
								+ Adjust smoothstep
							+ Fix Mako
								+ With formula
						+ Rearc & optimize shader
						+ Darker
						+ Fix Y overrun: need another clamp
						+ Fix other disappearing fishes
					+ Position update: incorporate dt, so eventually adjust species' speeds
						+ We already had to multiply mako's speed (13) by dt
						+ Verify that speed in json now matches real world
					+ Scale the following with fish size adjustment:						
						+ Radius of interactive disturbance & attraction
						+ Velocity
					+ Add fish speed adjustment
						+ Param
						+ SettingsDialog
						+ Use @ dynamics
						+ Adjust min and max
						+ Change velocities on the fly
					+ Gravity free-fall must not take size adjustment nor speed adjustment into account
					+ aka: Speed adjustment and size adjustment only apply to swimming
						+ Just in MakeBasalVelocity then
					+ Bug: fish becoming above water while steering - does not free fall
					+ World border:
						+ Clamp at spawn
						+ Simple collision check w/immediate bounce, not excluding other collision checks
						+ Check during free falling as well!
					+ Rename size adjust
				+ New algo:
					+ Turning (if isTurning)
					+ Pos update
					+ Panic check X 4
						+ General panic state:
							+ Panic mode needs to slow down
								+ Panic mode slows down and ends when it reaches zero, no target really needed
								+ Re-disturbing sets it back to one
								+ Change shape of slow-down:
						+ Water level: dealing with fish getting over water level (because of waves, etc.)
							+ Solve issue of target position Y: we use current pos - something, but current pos might already be too late
								+ Try clamping it to water level
							+ Far from surface: normal bounce
							+ Close to surface: panic run
							+ Out of water: need new regime with fish falling:
								+ Different position update when depth < 0:
									+ Gravity
									+ X velocity as now, y clamped to <= 0
									+ Tail progress very fast
										+ Rename as "tail"
								+ ...and cut short state machine afterwards, as fish can't swim
								X See if this one suffices without the two explicit "water level" collision checks
						+ Ocean floor:
							+ Do check with head of fish
								+ Since there's no guarantee of world bounds compliance, clamp X
							x Test with small panic
							+ See why panic'd fish doesn't care
								+ Doesn't care when velocity is pointing outside of normal
								+ Do we keep it? Yes
							+ See why speeds up after bounce							
							+ Test also ship collision with sea floor, for Dx change!
						+ Interactive disturbance:
							+ Panic run:
								+ New target position: any
								+ New target velocity/direction:
									+ Direction along radius to disturbance point, but opposite direction
									+ Velocity: panic velocity
										+ Need to change CalculateVelocity: takes direction instead of start & end points
										! Using panic velocity comes for free
								+ Make sure that a second disturbance at the back of the fish just speeds it up
								+ Prevent panic direction from being too vertical
				+ Obstacles rearc as per Moleskine
			+ Try without u-turn at ocean floor
			+ Lower uturn limit width
			+ New target position:
				+ X constraints:
					+ Ensure X direction change
				+ Y constraints:
					+ Not too much y slope (wrt current)
			+ Superimpose sin over movement
				+ Resynchronize sync with tail
				+ Test with more pronounced superimposed sin during panic run				
			+ Tools:
				+ Think of rearc: instead of storing disturbances, act on fishes right away - exactly like we do with ship
					+ Need to reset u-turn
				+ Food/Scare
					+ Icons: 
						+ Food: little can, tilted at rest, rotated w/crumbles when used
						+ Scare: megaphone 45 degrees at rest, w/sound waves when used
					+ Sounds:
						+ Food: shaking powder
						+ Scare: children screaming
					+ Food: 
						+ Set target velocity to direction towards tool; auto-smoothing does the rest
						+ Enter panic mode with distance
						+ See if can make it so that fish jumps out of water - fix issue
							! Issue due to panic away from bounce -> panic towards food -> ...
						+ See if can randomize direction a bit - but not continuously
					+ Scare:
						+ Panic charge should be proportional to tool distance
						+ Ultra-violent mode
				+ Disturbances also from bombs, with large radius
					+ via mParentWorld.DisturbOcean(vec position, float fishScareRadius)
					+ Add TODO item at plan for sprays for bombs to reuse this, with other args
				+ Tsunami: widespread panic
					+ From World::TriggerTsunami, one-shot
				+ Thanos' snap: panic at interfaces
			+ Shoaling
				+ When adding new fish, distribute remaining counts among species according to swarm sizes
				+ Rearc Update() in three parts
				+ Do shoaling only if GameParameters::DoFishShoaling is set
				+ UpdateDynamics(): maintain sorted Xs in vector at position update
				+ Apply fish's max dimension to shoal spacing (which is in terms of bodies)
				+ Main algo:
					= Attempts:
						+ A: My own algo:
							+ A1: Fish.ShoalingVelocity = k*DeltaPos
								+ TargetRenderVector moves to CruiseSteering
									+ Auto-Smoothing always sets CurrentRenderVector to CurrentVelocity.normalise()
								+ Fix bursts
								+ ShoalingVelocity must scale with GameParameters x 2
									+ Also adjust ShoalingVelocity @ GameParameters' changes
									+ Zero out ShoalingVelocity when fish stops shoaling (via GameParameters)
								+ No U-turn check with ShoalingVelocity
									+ ShoalingVelocity is not supposed to change direction
										+ Remove u-turn code
								+ DeltaPos calc'd using new target pos each time
									+ Sum of deltas of shoaling position is normalized and added with weight to target velocity								
								+ Add sliders for Shoal Neighborhood Radius Adjustment and Shoal Cohesion Strength Adjustment
									+ Verify: velocity should be proportional to distance																
							+ A2: Direction change based on neighbours								
								+ If at least one in neighborhood - regardless of being visible or not - has direction opposite
								  to fish's, and its last directionChangeTimestamp (set at UTurnEmplace) is > ours, then we turn
								+ Only changes TargetVelocity, not ShoalingVelocity
								+ Also calculate new target position
								+ Fix mad-uturning with larger radius
									+ Add back age limit on own u-turn
							+ Try ours, with changes we did for guy's algo:
								+ First off, commit
								+ No "direction of vision"								
								+ break after u-turn							
						+ B: guy's algo:
							+ Clone UpdateShoaling altogether
							+ B1: Movement vector
							+ B2: Collision vector (closest neighbour among those closer to fish than spacing)
							+ B3: Cohesion vector (furthest neighbour among those further from fish than spacing)
							+ The weighted sum of the three + target direction determines ShoalingVelocity
								! We do ShoalingVelocity instead of TargetVelocity to avoid spring effect

		! Spec:
			! Physics:
				! For each underwater frontier point:
					! Ocean surface disturbation proportional to:
						a) Velocity of point (its vertical component only)
						b) Depth of point 
						c) May be: normal of frontier at the point
			! Computation:
				! Done at frontier visit in ship, by simply accumulating delta's in OceanSurface
				! These delta's will then be materialized into real surface y's at the next OceanSurface::Update (after being smoothed via a low-pass filter)
					! Yes, this generates a lag between the ship entering the water, and the surface moving for it, but we hope it won't be noticeable
					! With this deferred scheme though, we have the following pro's:
						! Not having to recalculate cached point depths
						! Not having to materialize ocean surface delta's at each *ship*'s Update() (we can do it once for all ships, and at OceanSurface::Update() which is more adept)
						! All frontiers in all ships still get to see the original surface, and thus there's no risk of one affecting the next
							! However, we might not want delta's to be cumulative. For example, if CC 1 sees y=0 and makes delta=-3, and CC2 sees y=0 and makes delta=-2, we might not
							  want to end up with delta=-5. See if should use a "max" thing instead
		+ Impl:

								+ Clear it in cctor with fill()

					+ Materialized into samples during UpdateFields()
					+ Then zeroed out at end of UpdateFields(), so it's ready for the next cycle
				+ Wave generation:
					+ pointDepth (capped) * (1 - Smoothstep(0, maxDepth, depth)) // no velocity here, velocity influences maxDepth already
			+ Step 3: add smoothing
				! Smoothing is needed: it removes little spikes (exactly the same spikes we used to get with bubbles)
				+ constexpr constant gives width of smoothing, so we may experiment
					+ Make delta buffer size==SamplesCount + 2 * (DeltaSmoothingWidth/2) // or just +(DeltaSmoothingWidth/2), depends on whether we need right part or not
			+ Step 4: nail down displacement calculation
				+ Temporarily alter UpdateFields() to use DeltaHeight buffer directly, without SWE and with/without smoothing
				+ At small velocities, displacement should be greater
					+ Plot displacement by velocity
					+ Find curve
						+ Piecewise quadratic + linear
				+ Incorporate mass, so that light wooden ball doesn't create as many waves

						+ Move and Rotate interactions: should zero-out non-spring forces as well? Otherwise yet-to-integrate forces might generate torques after rotation
				+ Theory: this might happen because the force is calculated once on a certain position configuration, and then integrated multiple times during the
				  spring iteration loop, with particles changing positions - and likely getting in a configuration that causes torque
					+ Solution: last spring iteration step calls ApplyHydrostaticPressureForces() before Integrate()

						- Every non-hull material: C=1.0 N=1.0

		+ SoundController: uses own sound.isPlaying as state and starts @ event/stops @ update
			+ Uses two consecutive Update() w/no Draw in-between as stop
			+ how to loop though?
	+ Rethink notification of Draw and Swirl events
		+ Remove from GameController, fire at tool via "Toggled(bool)" events
		+ Remove magic from SoundController
		+ Can always modulate sounds at Tool::Update, for example asking GameController::IsUnderwater(screen coords)
			+ Do at Chainsaw, do underwater sound
				+ Change event handler:
					+ OnSaw(opt<bool> isUnderwater): off, on overwater, on underwater
		+ Test: get rid of all FlushEvents outside of update
			+ If OK, remove commented-out code
	+ Reset sound controller at ResetAndLoadShip()
	+ Water rushing-in

+ Fix: When land is above water, water is upside down

+ Optimization: to improve locality: points in contiguous buffer
	+ No PointerVector but (fixed) std::vector<Point>, and others point to locations in the vector
	+ Points never deleted, just marked
		+ So have to check point.IsDeleted() each time the Point buffer is iterated
		+ No check
	+ Point destroy: also clear *own* references
	+ Try contiguous buffer also with springs and triangles
		+ And not checking isDeleted
			+ Remove assert's
		+ Multi-step create loop
		+ Spring destroy: also clear *own* references
		+ Triangle destroy: also clear *own* references
		+ Do check IsDeleted for Spring and Triangle operations that may affect connected non-deleted points
		+ New perf: 15.7/15.8
		+ See ElementContainer::range(start, end)
			+ UnitTests, verify last excluded
	+ IsDeleted needs only be checked at SpringRender and TriangleRender
	+ Try fast_qrt for vec2f::length()
	+ Test fast_XYZ at vector
		+ fast_inv_sqrt: 15.2/15.3/15.3
		+ 1/sqrt: 15.3/15.3/15.3
		+ Nuke'em if ok
	+ EventTickerPanel is stealing 1.99% even when not shown

+ Render optimization: only upload spring elements, triangle elements when they're dirty (deletion occurred)
	+ Get perf analysis first:
		- Game::Render: 34.90%:     Ship::Render: 31.53% (Incl)	3.05% (Excl)
			- RenderShipEnd: 28.24%	- Ship::RegisterDeletion: sets mAreSprings/TrianglesDirty=true
	+ cctor: true
	+ set to false after uploaded to RenderContext
	+ Move XRay flag consumption to RenderContext

+ Now that we have connected components, fix covering of ship pieces:
	+ Draw batches of triangles and springs by component, so that pieces are "covered" nicely
		+ Ship keeps track of # of connected components and of each size
		+ At RenderXYZ(), allocate N buffers for the vertex indices and dispatch each triangle/spring
		  to the correct buffer based off ConnectedComponentID
			+ ConnectedComponentID passed by caller (spring or triangle) based off the (first) point
			  of the primitive
				+ assert other points have same ID
			+ Note: points themselves are not affected by this; they're still uploaded in their entirety
			  once per cycle
		+ At RenderXYZEnd(), draw each connected component buffer from last to first
		+ Do for triangles
		+ Do for springs
		+ Each connected component must be drawn together - its springs then its triangles

+ Technical Debt:
	+ Resources: lowercase filenames
		+ git
		+ code
	+ /Data
	+ /Ships
		+ Uppercase ship filenames
		+ Code (ResourceLoader)
		+ source (git)
		+ CMake
	+ MainFrame::Die(msg of exc)
	+ Get rid of Game.cpp and move functionality to GameController
		+ ResourceLoader::LoadDefaultShip()
		+ Also, don't load default ship autonomously (need to register event handlers before that happens);
		  rely on MainFrame calling GameController::LoadDefaultShip() after registration
	+ Change calls to Point::SubtractFromLastPosition() to AddToLastPosition() and use (& implement) unary '-' operator for vectors
	+ Points and Springs and Triangles::Destroy()'s are templated on Point/Spring/Triangle"Being"DeletedHandlers (others than self),
	  & ship passes own methods
		+ OR: even better, as handler never really changes: cctor takes handler at beginning, given by ship,
		  and stores as std::function
		+ Handlers invoked *before* actual deletion
			+ Comment on handlers on connected-to-argument might be deleted
		+ Not re-entrant - can't delete from within
		+ Handling of pinned point deletion is then done here
		+ See if also whole logic of point<->spring<->triangle can be done in handler
			+ If so, don't pass containers at various Destroy()'s
		+ Test
	+ CircularList::Erase unit test: complete verification of returned iterator
	+ Containers::Destroy and GameEventHandler::OnDestroy rearc:
		+ 3 containers are given shared_ptr<GameEventHandler> and ParentWorld & at cctor
		+ The 2 Destroy()'s fire events (after invoking DestroyHandler), unless otherwise specified
		  via DestroyOptions
		+ Ship's DestroyHandlers don't fire events anymore, and Ship::SpringDestroyHandler takes boolean
		  for triangles (translated from Springs::DetroyOptions)
		+ Test assert's with Debug build
	+ Move definition of ElementIndex et al into GameTypes.h
	+ Move also pinned points to a PinnedPoints class, just like Bombs
	+ Textures are json files, with world size, offset, and lighting boolean

	+ Fix issue with very fast rope sinking
		+ How's a wet rope different than iron hull? Test with test_ship.png
		+ It's because ropes get water (when broken) and gravity force is based off point_mass+water, while integration only uses point_mass
			+ In fact it also applies to all light hulls that are broken
		+ See if can apply buoyancy always, and thus get rid of Points::Buoyancy
			+ Nope: too many hull materials would float
		+ NOPE: Apply water mass at Integrate then? And what about springs - should use new mass there as well?
		+ Two possible fixes:
			+ Just don't consider water at gravity if buoyancy=0 (i.e. if hull)
				- i.e. revert the buoyancy fix
				- result is that wet hull points never feel water weight (and neither buoyancy)
			+ THIS ONE: Or, buoyancy=0 points (i.e. hull points) never take water, period
				+ i.e. they are never set leaking upon spring destruction
				+ First figure out how internal hull gets wet - if it does - IT DOES NOT!


	+ Move RenderContext et al into Render:: namespace and file group
			+ See if TextureTypes.h is still needed and whether it can be moved to GameTypes
				+ After all, ShipRenderMode is in GameTypes
				+ Polygon for now moves to that class that makes it

	+ ToolController rearc:
		+ ToolController has pointer to SoundController, and tells the latter when to play and stop tools' sounds
		+ IGameEventHandler events then exist only for the world-generated noises (e.g. something really breaking), not
		  for the tools
		  + So Swirl, for example, should disappear from IGameEventHandler; some others as well
		  + Tools don't invoke IGameEventHandler->OnSwirl(), for example
		  + Removed:
			+ OnSaw
			+ OnDraw
			+ OnSwirl

	+ CMake:
		+ INSTALL target for release
		+ RelWithDebInfo: Inline any suitable (/Ob2)

	+ Optimizations:
		+ Take perf analysis of circuit test 1 (2 mins Circuit Test 1)
			- World::Update: 30.15%
				- UpdateElectricalConn: 0.06%
					- Deque::new: 0.01%
					- Deque::~: 0.01%
				- ElectricalElements::Update: 0.05%
				- DiffuseLight: 0.43%
		+ Ship::DiffuseLight: see inverting nested loops (for each lamp: for each point)
			+ Need test ship with many more lamps
			+ Before perf analysis: DiffuseLight: 35.83% == ~30,000 samples; fps=22.10
			+ Switch loops:
				+ Requires first point light zeroing!
				+ After perf analysis: DiffuseLight: 30.63%; fps=24.x
		+ Do perf analysis with complex graph
			+ Need circuit test 3
			+ Impact negligible: Ship::UpdateElectricalConnectivity: 0.21%
	+ Diffusion:
		+ Can test it by itself, by using light material and by cheating with current!
		+ After current propagation:
			+ Zero out mLight of each point (use generation sequence number? useful for other Point properties?)
				+ No, easier and probably faster to do it in same pass as LeakWater - LeakWaterAndZeroLight()
		+ Diffusion: propagate mLight to adjacent points (incl. other lamps),
		  inv. proportional to distance^2, with a graph flood stopping at max distance
		+ Point.GetColour() takes also into account mLight (from itself, not from lamp)
                  and makes alpha blend just like water
		+ Need "off" color to use at lamp point when Lamp is off (different than structural color),
		  used when rendering point in springs/triangles/points
			+ Not used when using textures, of course
			+ Needs material's Color to split in StructuralColor and RenderColor (set to the same except for lamps)
	+ Diffusion improvement: see if can simply add light (rather than max'ing it)
		+ Need to ensure sum is always < 1.0
		+ Or just set to max(1.0, cur+new)
			+ Best when done in point->lamp loop: add up in inner loop, then assign to point as max
			+ Doesn't improve look considerably, and still requires an if

+ Bugs:
	+ Ship::Render: when there are no changes to elements and we keep uploading stressed springs, we don't reset the count
	  in ShipRenderContext::mElementBufferSizes
		+ Fix simply by having Start and End for uploading stressed springs
		+ Done in FB branch
	+ No default args @ vec cctors
		+ Done in FB branch
	+ Fix mem leak
		+ Plan:
			+ Calc base rate of growth: 500K/sec
			+ Comment out ShipRenderContext::Render halves until find the one
				+ When nothing done in loop: 159K max
				+ Just PinnedPoints: grows fast
				+ No texture & no buffer: grows fast
				+ No parameters: grows extremely slow
				! No OrthoMatrix param, Yes AmbientLight param: grows fast
				+ Yes OrthoMatrix param, No AmbientLight param: grows extremely slow
			+ Undo all (dbl-check)
			+ Commit other work
			+ glHint(..._HINT) x 2 at Render::Start()
		+ Cut down on calls to glSetParameter:
			+ Before FPS: 27.4
			+ ShipRenderContext::SetXYZ (ortho, visible world coordinates, and light)
				+ Sets into all programs

					+ Copy from generic textures
					+ Same plane as fire, but will have deterministic deep sort: fire drawn first, explosion next
				+ Revert to no start/end

				+ New Explosion upload
					+ Args:
						+ vec2 centerPosition
						+ float halfQuadSize // of quad side
						+ float progress
						+ float personalitySeed
							+ Used for rotation, calc'd at ShipRenderContext::UploadXYZ(.)
				+ New render step
			+ Do initial testing by temporarily replacing Bomb's Upload() with new explosion upload
			+ Commit
			+ Make infrastructure for multiple explosions:
				+ Single shader, single atlas
					+ Atlas name: "explosions"
					+ Texture group name: "explosions"
			+ Ship: needs own state machine for explosions
				+ Does: rendering; creation of each frame's force field;
					+ i.e. has Update() and Upload()
					+ State is simulation-time based, as it's inherently physical
						! And after all, the current bomb explosions do a fixed number of steps at 20ms intervals,
						  hence they are basically frame-based
				+ Replaces normal bombs' blast callback: DoBombExplosion -> StartBombExplosion
					+ Start IShipStructureHandler while you're at it
					+ Fixed blast position (verify with the various bombs that it's fixed - should not move in fact)
				+ Mechanics update:
					+ 1) go through state machines, insert force fields
					+ 2) ...apply force fields...
					! 3) update bombs& combustion -> trigger explosions
						! Will come at next frame, like now
				+ Expires when progress reaches max lifetime parameter (float seconds)
				+ StateMachine update:
					+ Nail down blast
						+ See if need to force last blast (capped @ blastradius)
					+ Make gfx explosion size match blast radius
						+ Adjust gfx size at ShipRenderContext, if needed
					+ Nail down duration
			+ Cleanup bombs: (verify all call the same Ship::DoBombExplosion(.))
				+ No bomb does anymore Explosion state machine - they all expire at detonation,
				  after sending Explosion to ship
				+ Only explosions are in simulationTime, rest is still wallClockTime
				+ Do at:
					+ Impact Bomb
					+ Timer
				+ Remove DoBombExplosion from IShipStructureHandler
			+ Explosion physics: smoother, points entering radius at last get too much force
			+ Gfx improvements:
				+ Test temporarily w/very slow progress and make sure all frames are shown
				+ See if scaling should go or remain
				+ Need mipmapped atlas? Test w/zoom
				+ Fix two issues:
					+ Frame -1 is visible:
						+ Try with clamping to dead center
					+ Dark rectangles
				+ Frames
					+ Test without curves at frames (i.e. making them darker)
					+ Do other explosions
						+ Make sure may call new texture files "explosion2_..." and have them still matched by TextureDatabase
						+ RegularAtlas: need to live with incomplete power of two
							+ Fill-in with first frame
						+ Explosion 2
							+ [49, 60] (12), 62, 64, 66, 68
						+ Explosion 3
							+ Make psd
						+ Explosion 4
							+ [121, 130] (10), 133, 137, 140, 144, 147, 151
							+ Try without any mask boosting
							+ Then, try with center alpha brushed towards 1.0
							+ Reboost center
							+ Double-check final fade out
						+ Shader texture coords dead center:
							+ Make dead center at upload
						+ Speedup alpha pre-multiply
						+ Shader: take explosion index as input
							+ ShipRenderContext::UploadExplosion:
								+ For test, set index to one
								+ Then, takes ExplosionType as arg
									+ Deflagration: randomly choose between 0 and 2
									+ Swap explosions 3 and 4
							+ Struct, VAO
							+ Shader
			+ Cleanup:
				+ Complete IShipPhysicsHandler
					+ Move "structure handlers" into it
					+ Register IShipPhysicsHandler with each container
						+ Test all
					+ See if may move "Ship repaired" from repair interaction into both spring/triangle
					  restore handler
				+ Nuke old explosion textures
				+ Nuke GameTypes' texture groups for RC and Timer bomb explosions
				+ Bake atlas:
					+ Rearc textures:
						! There's a json for each TextureDatabase
						+ The json is 1:1 with an enum (and its traits for str<->enum):
							+ Enums are in GameTypes

						+ Split jsons
						+ Refactor TextureDatabase

							+ See if there's any "element-like" struct for which only the container
							  should reference TextureGroups, element might not have to know about its coords
						+ Refactor TextureAtlas
							+ Templated on groups
							+ TextureAtlasBuilder<Traits> has now also static builder method that takes an entire database - TextureDatabase<Traits>
							+ See if there's any "element-like" struct for which only the container
							  should reference TextureGroups, element might not have to know about its coords
						+ UploadedTextureManager: also per-groups
						+ RenderContext instantiates different TextureDatabase<Traits>'s
						+ Unit tests

		+ Auto-Texturizer
			! Spec: new ShipTexturizer class, owned by GameController
				- Created at GameController create time, and kept forever
					- Maintains cache
				- Also at create time does MaterialDB <-> actual textures check, brokered by GameController (see below)
				- Also holds auto-texturization mode setting, see below
				- Auto-Texturization mode (exposed @ SettingsDialog::Rendering), dictates what to do when ship doesn't come with a
				  texture; two modes:
					- "FlatStructure": builds texture using structural materials' RenderColor (as opposed to color key like now)
					- "MaterialTextures": using materials' "bump maps"
						- Textures are semi-transparent "bump maps" that are drawn on matte structural material color
						- Textures/Materials folder contains textures
						- Structural material has new mandatory "texture_name" string arg
							- Material DB <-> actual textures check: done by GameController at its Create() time,
							  invoking ShipTexturizer::VerifyMaterialsDatabase(MaterialsDatabase const &)
					- Setting storage is @ ShipTexturizer, brokered by GameController
				- Both texturizations implemented in ShipTexturizer class as invoked by ShipBuilder
				! Edge smoothing is already done by means of tessellation
			+ ShipAutoTexturizationMode At GameTypes
			+ ResourceLocator::GetMaterialTexturesFolderPath()
			+ Nuke TextureOrigin @ ShipDefinition & Ship/RenderContext
			+ ShipDefinition::TextureLayerImage is now optional
				= Copy structure->texture code to ShipTexturizer
			+ Path:
				+ GameController::AddShip:
					+ Load Definition
					+ World->AddShip(definition, ..., renderContext)
						+ ShipBuilder::Create -> [ship, texture image]
						+ RenderContext::AddShip(texture image)
							+ Validate texture size
			+ GameController creates instance of ShipTexturizer at Create time
				+ Simple member
				+ Then invokes ShipTexturizer::VerifyMaterialsDatabase(MaterialsDatabase const &)
			+ ShipTexturizer instance is passed by GameController to ShipBuilder (via World)
			+ ShipBuilder uses ShipTexturizer to create - and return - texture
				+ Args:
					+ ShipBuildTypes.h:
						+ Definition (using) of ShipBuildPointIndexMatrix
						+ ShipBuildPoint
				+ First experiment: current (legacy) structure texture
					+ Simple Nx magnify
				+ Invoke from ShipBuilder
			+ StructuralMaterial has new mandatory "texture_name" string arg
				+ For now just optional
			+ Do texturizations
				+ FlatStructure:
				+ MaterialTextures:
					+ MaterialTextureMagnificationFactor:
						+ Getter and setter
						+ Upon setting: store mMaterialTextureWorldToPixelConversionFactor = 1/.
					+ Do bilinear and multiply
					+ ShipTexturizer's cache:
						+ Has LRU cache of textures, maintaining count of accesses and sorting+purging with H and L watermarks
						+ Cache usage counts are reset at beginning of each new texturization - but textures are not purged
					+ Perf:
						+ Start: Heat Generation Test: 998/1050ms
						+ Try converting material texture to floats first
							+ New ImageData instantiation: vec3f
							+ ImageTools: conversion
							+ Do at load time and store in cache
						+ Factor out WorldW,Y and keep adding
						+ Heat Generation Test: 962/1032ms
						+ Verify Cartman

					Dear Shipmates, It's finally time for 1.15.2 to come out and find its rightful place on your computers!
					As previously anticipated, this release consists of mostly technical improvements across the board, which smooth out some rough edges of Floating Sandbox and pave the way for fantastic improvements in the future.
					Here's the list of changes in this release:
					...
					P.S.: this release was timed with theDARKTURRET's YouTube premiere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCEvFRpRv-0

			+ Investigate:
				- No threading: lags
				- SwapBuffers log (@MainFrame, 3): lag (not swapbuffers)
				- SwapBuffers + UploadStart log (4): lag (neither of them)
				- UploadStart + Draw:
				- OnGameTimerTrigger: lag (one timer tick every 5 s) 05:05:43.515398:OnGameTimerTrigger; 05:05:47.873422:OnGameTimerTrigger; 05:05:52.227233:OnGameTimerTrigger
				- OnGameTimerTrigger (start and GameController::RunGameIteration) + PostGameTimer: lag (RunGameIteration takes 4 secs)
				- GameController::RunGameIteration::4 steps: lag (Render Draw -> end of function: takes 4 secs)
				- RenderContext::Draw: glFinish_start/glFinish_end/swapbuffers_end: NO lag
				- RenderContext::Draw: glFinish_end/swapbuffers_end: lag, none of these

		+ UpdateMasses: converge _slowly_ towards target
			+ Try to repro issue with ship having water material that breaks (my_ship_structure-water_air_issue.png on Desktop)

		+ Add velocity probe gadget
			+ Requires Gadget Rearc (*) first
			+ Font rearc
				+ See first sizes of both font textures: 256x256
				+ TextureTypes: font groups w/one group only
				+ Move RenderTypes::TextType to private of NotificationRenderContext
					+ Specialize RenderContext/NotificationRenderContext methods, which simply fw to helper w/enum value
				+ TextNotificationContext carries FontMetadata & and atlas frame metadata & of own font
				+ Init: of all fonts, make one single texture (linear atlas)+vao+vbo
				+ Lines: per-type of text notification, rather than per-font
				+ Uploads:
					+ Mark individual TextNotificationContext's dirty flag 
				+ RenderPrepareTextNotifications:
					+ If any TextNotificationContext has dirty text:
						+ Regenerate its quad vertex buffer
						+ Clear TextNotificationContext dirty text flag
						+ Remember to re-upload whole vertex buffer
					+ If need to re-upload whole vertex buffer:
						+ Upload whole vertex buffer via multiple sub-uploads
				+ Font::Metadata rearc:
					+ Font::Fontmetadata is basic straight from font (integers, etc.), and no EmitQuadVertices
					+ A new struct in NotificationRenderContext ("FontTextureAtlasMetadata") contains the atlas/texture-scaled version
					+ A new EmitQuadVertices() method in NotificationRenderContext contains the code that was from Fontmetadata
					+ mFonts goes and store instead vector of FontMetadata
					+ Make allocation sticky
				+ Draw: make one single call
			+ GameController logic: always-present state machine 
				+ Implements driving of NotificationLayer's PhysicsProbePanel
				+ Emits panel sound events
				+ Implements event handler and decides when to pass probe reading event through to NotificationLayer					
			+ Move state machine from GameController into NotificationLayer
				+ NotificationLayer gets EventDispatcher at cctor
				+ Initial delay before starting panel
				+ Tells NotificationRenderContext when text should disappear (i.e. whet opened transitions from 1.0 to != 1.0)
			+ NotificationLayer:
				+ Uploads panel's opened to NotificationRenderContext at next Upload()
					+ Needs dirty flag
				+ Uploads reading and/or clear to NotificationRenderContext at next Upload()						
					+ mIsPhysicsProbeReadingDirty flag (like others)
			+ NotificationRenderContext:
				+ New NotificationRenderContext notification "type": PhysicsProbePanel
					+ Upload is sticky: when uploaded, clears buffers, creates vertices, and sets dirty flag
						+ When opened==0.0, clears the buffer and stops
					+ RenderPrepare: upload if dirty
						+ Alloc if size > allocated
						+ And clear dirty flag
					+ RenderDraw: draw if vertices not empty
					+ Texture for background of panel
						+ 200x100
						+ Speed
						+ Temperature
					+ See right noise texture (we want the "rough" one, i.e. small)
					+ Panel grows vertically first

			+ Cleanup:
				+ Gadgets spring->point rearc: 
					+ First off, verify gadgets currently freeze when their spring is destroyed - which we'll fix with this change
					+ Move "IsGadgetAttached" shebang from Springs to Points
					+ See if can move detachment from point (i.e. for mass) completely to Gadgets, just like
					  attachment is
					+ Overall: Gadget attachment: to ship points (no ephemeral) which are attached to at least one spring and which
					  have no other gadgets attached
						+ Gadget base remembers point's first spring index for giving back rotation angle
							+ "TrackedSpringIndex"
						+ On spring destroy: do same trick as now, crystallize angle
					+ PhysicsProbe final tasks:
						+ Gadgets::OnSpringDestroyed: also deal with PhysicsProbe
						+ Toggle algo:
							+ If there's a probe in radius: remove it and done
								+ Publish event: removal makes sound
								+ return false
							+ Else if found good candidate particle:
								+ If there's already a probe on the ship: remove it (basically we move it)
									+ No event: (we're moving it) (no removal sound)
								+ Create new probe
									+ If we are not moving: publish event (sound)
								+ return true if we are not moving, else nullopt
							+ Else:
								+ return nullopt
						+ See if may move mGameEventHandler->OnGadgetRemoved(.) call from each gadget's OnExternallyRemoved() to where we invoke
						  OnExternallyRemoved in Gadgets
						+ Merge removal code in Toggle() and RemovePhysicsProbe()
					+ Cleanup:
						+ Gadgets: see if may unify ToggleGadget<T>/TogglePhysicsProbeGadget
							+ Or at least use same procedures when adding and removing a gadget														  
						+ See if IGadget::GetPosition is really needed
							+ If it's needed, then also add GetPlaneId()
						+ Rendering: it seems order of gadgets and explosions is screwed
							+ It's a problem with the bomb being detached upon explosion and thus taking a new Z plane; freeze plane ID as well
					+ Tests:
						+ Run all scenarios in debug, for all gadgets
						+ Freezing of rotation axis @ spring destroy
						+ Detachment at bomb explosions: make sure explosion does not move
				+ Make RenderContext expose GetNoficationRenderContext() and nuke all forwards

		+ Sinking speed:
			! Real Titanic's bow sank at 10.7m/s or 15m/s, FS sinks at 6..7m/s				
			+ We get to 10m/s by lowering Global Damp Adjust to 0.08, so consider not applying global damp for underwater points, which means:
				+ Copy old exe first
				+ Take speeds with old:
					+ Titanic sinking: 6.4m/s (@ GlobalDampAdjust==0.00: 36.7)
					+ Plane falling: touchdown is at 41m/s (@ GlobalDampAdjust==0.00: 97m/s)
				+ Test with following global damps, looking at explosions, debris, etc. in *air*
					+ 1: with water intake at minimum, particles/springs dance for a very long time
					+ 0: some violent ejections of springs, but nothing broken
					+ 0: with water intake at minimum, particles/springs accelerate
				+ Old math:
					+ Verify global damp == 0 means no vel damping at Ship::IntegratePoints(.)
					+ globalDampingCoefficient=0.99988; velocityBuffer[i] = deltaPos / dt * globalDampingCoefficient;

		+ Repair improvement:
			+ See if it's due to triangle forming folded
				+ Add log when we calc a point's destination, if that point repair would result in a new triangle
				  that is NOT clockwise wrt current point positions
				+ Prevent CCW triangle from being formed altogether
			+ Improvements to try:
				X Attractor must have more springs attached than attractee
				+ Local consistency of attractor/attractee roles: ensure that if one particle is attractor, also its directed neighbors are
					! Spec:
						- Pass 1: for each point p that is in radius and which was an attractor in the previous step and which has not been an attractee in this step
						  and which needs reparation:
							- RepairFromPoint(p)
								- Conditions for being an attractee: not having been an attractor in this step
								- Upon spring restore: forget attractee role at this step
							- Visit all points p' from graph visit starting at p, such that: p' is in radius and needs reparation and has not been an attractor in this step and has
							  not been an attractee in this step
								- Do visit breadth first, truncating when not in radius or when doesn't need reparation or when has been attractee in this step or when has been attractor
								  in this step
						- Pass 2: find new points p that are in radius and which have not been already an attractor in this step and which have not been an attractee in this step
						  and which need reparation:
							- RepairFromPoint(p)
							- Visit all points p' from graph visit starting at p, such that: ...
					+ Impl:

							+ LastAttractorRepairStepSequenceNumber, LastAttractee...: type is SequenceNumber
						+ Tool:
							+ Pass just sequence number
							+ Increase seq num (skip) at each mouse down
						+ Do
				+ See why roles sometimes flip
					+ Attractee from prev step becomes attractor
				+ Try to straighten out CCW structures
					+ Idea 1: as a separate, initial step, before repairing: for each two-now_naked-spring arc, make sure two springs are in right angle wrt central point
					+ Idea 2: expand idea 1: as a pre-step: for each in-radius point: for each naked spring: make sure it's in right angle
					+ If works, consider doing trying these which at the moment we can't do because of
					  folded structures:
						x Remove role-taking: allow attractor to take on role of attractee, and viceversa
						+ Lower distance tolerance (e.g. 0.03 or lower), to prevent newly-repaired springs from breaking up immediately again
						x Allow each particle to act as attractee only once per step
				+ Larger radius: 4
				+ Final velocity of restored particle is avg of all connected
				+ Velocities:
					X Issue with half titanic: try with more inertial velocity
					X Issue with dancing dots: try: target pos is half-way between offseted with attractor's velocity * dt
						+ Variable names for point/other endpoint: attractorPoint and attracteePoint

	+ 1.17.5:

		+ Laser Cannon tool (*)

		+ Fix: GameController ends up being deleted by SwitchboardPanel - might be the cause of the "blocking" issue on GTK
			! It happens because mElectricalPanel (SwitchboardPanel uq_ptr) is added to MainFrame, hence it's deleted by it *AND* by later uq_ptr
			+ Major issue: everything that's added to sizers, etc. should NOT be a uq_ptr
				+ EventTicker
				+ ProbePanel
				+ MainGLCanvas
			X See if GTK issue is gone

			+ "lights severed" flag becomes opt<enum> ("for water", "for severed")
				+ Set as "For water" when power source is cutoff because of water
					! Note: current causes for "severed":
						- Destroyed elements
						- OnElectricSpark
						- UpdateSourcesAndPropagation: Power generator transitioning into NotProducingCurrent
					! Note: "severed" is consumed at lamp state machine transitioning from LightOn (for any cause), to decide whether
					  to turn off immediately or through flicker
					+ Make sure only set at PowerSource being down and at destroyed elements (not at lamp being down)
				+ Severed is cleaned up at end of UpdateSinks
					+ So clean here whole opt<enum>
			+ At lamp state machine: use a single opt<PowerFailureNextState> storing first decision on whether or not to do it
			+ Lamp::State contains TransientApertureMultiplier, and that's the one messed with by state
				+ And of course it's used when uploading to lights buffer, multiplied with actual aperture
				+ Reset at Restore()

	+ 1.18.0:
		+ Show build date @ Credits

		+ New OceanSurface interaction experiment:
			+ 1. Tool: only interacts with OceanSurface at Update(), using last known button state & mouse position
			+ 2. OceanSurface:
				+ a. New "InteractiveWaves" buffer with:
					+ CurrentHeight
					+ TargetHeight
					+ CurrentVelocity
				+ b. @ Update():				
					+ b1. Remove SWE interactive state machine update
					+ b2. Add new InteractiveWaves update
						+ Magick goes here
						+ State machine should take into account current SWE height field to avoid adding delta's over delta's:
							+ Interactive state machine:
								X Opt 1: TargetHeight is absolute, so might also be reached naturally by SWE
									X Then force exherted must depend on delta behind current SWE height and target 
									X TODO: but then we have a problem with zero-ing - if we zero target to current SWE height, perturbations never disappear
								X Opt 2: TargetHeight is relative (to 0.0), but we need some kung-fu when we incorporate into SWE height field in order to prevent adding delta's over delta's
									- TODO: but then we compound delta's: we add a delta to SWE height field, then we add it again at the next iteration
								+ Opt 3:
									+ Target height is absolute
									+ Target height reset to SWE height field at end of Update
									+ At beginning of update: interactive state machine updated, and _now_ its output set into SWE height, _before_ SWE height update
									+ Try coefficient approach
										+ Do anti-cuspid and see if it fixes a) cuspid and b) not reaching target height
											+ Wider?
												+ If no works: use non-linear ratio, more radius at low values
										+ Cleanup									
										X Try without height growth coefficient growth
										+ Try larger cuspid
										+ Add comment on fall rate
										+ See rates for fall vs raise, and fine-tune
											+ Ask Mattia
										+ See if we want waves to rise faster at small H
											+ GrowthCoeffGrowtRate should be higher at small height
												+ 1.0f at 0.0, InteractiveRaiseHeightGrowthCoefficientGrowthRate at ~1.0
										+ Cleanup 2
											+ Incl. vectorization
							+ Take pointer size
						+ Fix cuspid
							+ Analysis:
								+ The cuspid we see is the result of setting H and running two field cycles;
									+ First, the H we set at x=X becomes Dt / Dx * (velocityField[i] - velocityField[i + 1]) smaller
									+ Then, for any target H, there are two "regime" H's:
										+ The one at x=X - lower than H - and the one in the neighborhood, extending to infinite
										+ The cuspid itself is our interpolation! It's just that the regime H at x=X is way higher than the regime H at its neighboring cells
											+ Add all of this as comment to code, top of OceanSurface
					+ b3. @ calculate samples: add CurrentHeight from this new buffer
						+ OR: copy (add) CurrentHeight to DeltaHeightBuffer at previous step
					+ b4. Zero out TargetHeight
				+ c. Misc other improvements to OceanSurface:
					+ Try with swapping coeff growth and height growth
					+ Try texture anchor change
						= Nice when we anchor at bottom (e.g. 0.0f) and leave top "almost static" (static would be yTop - yVisibleWorldBottom, almost is yTop * 0.75f - yVisibleWorldBottom),
						  but ugly when one zooms out					 
					+ Mid ocean border line more transparent
					X Try adding back field advection
						+ Add an interactive way to turn on and off to appreciate difference
					X Try changing speed of waves
					X Try incorporating wind speed in SWE velocity field
					+ Try moving Tsunami & RogueWave to new Interactive system
						+ Still need state machines for these, which will invoke AdjustTo
						+ Tsunami will want a slow growth, while RogueWave would be fine with current interactive speed
							+ Pass AymptoticRate as param
								+ Requires our curve to work better: serious 1.0 at low height, real AymptoticRate at 6.0				
				+ d. Cleanup:
					+ Tool: no need to invoke when turning off; just invoke simply each time mouse button is pressed
						+ Also cleanup OceanSurface::AdjustToHeight() then
							+ And remove current simulation time arg altogether
					+ Nuke old SWE interactive state machine
						+ After replacing Tsunami & RogueWave with it
			+ 3. Try with from-to
				+ If doesn't work: Tool: reset mIsEngaged
				+ Test sound
			+ 4. Port to Android

		+ New ambient light control: Full day/night
			+ @ GameController:
				! Toggles based on current time-of-day value
				! Old controls are really about time-of-day
				+ GameController:Set/GetAmbientLightIntensity replaced by TimeOfDay
					+ Own parameter
					+ Method renames up to MainFrame
					+ Initial ToD
				+ GameController::SetTimeOfDay maps tod to ambient light intensity (->RenderContext), sun rays inclination (->RenderContext)
				+ GameController::DaylightCycle state machine's Update() calls IGameControllerSettings::SetTimeOfDay()
					+ SM doesn't need RenderContext anymore
				+ GameController::ToggleFullDayOrNight()
			+ MainFrame: menu item: "Full day/night"
				+ GameController::ToggleFullDayOrNight()
				+ => Localization task

		+ Enhanced sea rendering: rays of light
			+ Fuzzier borders
			+ Inclination
				+ Base:
					+ Param: sunRaysInclination: 0.0==vertical, 1.0/-1.0==45/-45 degrees
						+ Shader
						+ Params enum
						+ Set to 1.0
					+ Use of param
				+ Depending on time-of-day
					+ Map time of day so that:
						- amb=1.0 => ri=1.0 (so that default is +45 degrees)
						- amb=0.0 => ri=-1.0 (so that at night we've flipped to -45 degrees)
				+ Should we map instead the _whole_ NDC space into the buffer (thus making the buffer 3x as large to maintain resolution), so to fix inclination?
			+ "Too many clouds => all black" problem:
				+ Option 1: add (1-mean) to all values, so that mean becomes 1.0
					! Will have darks and lights
					+ Adjust so that we do not reduce darkness (0.0) when it's dark - YES, we keep it dark

				Dear shipmates,
				We are delighted to announce that Floating Sandbox 1.18.0 has entered the final beta testing phase! 
				The performance improvements in this release are so profound that we're going to need some time for testing before releasing to the general public, so expect another couple of weeks before this update is made public.
				In the meantime, you can read more about our adventures with the performance optimizations in the latest installment of our technical blog, [https://gabrielegiuseppini.wordpress.com/2023/07/02/adventures-with-2d-mass-spring-networks-part-iii/],
				and you can catch a quick preview of the rendering enhancements in our latest video:

+ 1.19.0:
	+ Npcs - take 1
		+ Merge into master
		+ Changelist

	+ Terrain tool: guide
		+ SHIFT starts guide == line via NotificationLayer
			+ While Shift is pressed, guide snaps to horizontal
			+ Releasing shift removes snapping but guide mode is maintained
		+ Terrain is then drawn only at left button up
		+ Impl:
			+ Completely separate state machine, guided by mEngagementData == enum mode, union of structs
				+ When in guide mode, we reason in screen coords - so e.g. start point is fixed on screen
				+ SimulationUpdate: talk to GameController iff in guide mode
			+ NotificationLayer/Context
		+ Display degrees
		+ Test:
			+ Sound
			+ Cursor
			+ Error		
		+ Add to changelist

	+ "Random" button to load random ship
		+ At LoadDialog

	+ Npcs post-work:
		= Work with TimCan for improvements
			= Chests
			= Square heads
			= Detail (e.g. ears) with shades
		+ Thinness: reduce
			+ Force both extremes synthetically
			+ Do something for head
		+ Furniture spinning too much around mouse
			+ Test WholeMesh (SHIFT)
		+ Friction work
			+ GameParameters::NpcFrictionAdjustment (for both, default 1)
			+ NpcDatabase: "FrictionSurfaceAdjustment" - w/comment for surface
				+ ParticleAttributes: member
				+ Humans globals: feet & head
				+ Per-furniture kind
					+ For all particles
				+ json
			+ Npcs:
				+ Func to calculate: in = material, surface adj, npc adj, global adj => float
				+ Members at particles: kinetic+static adjustments ("TotalAdjustment")
				+ At creation
				+ At param changes
					+ Separate loop: update particles'
				+ Use at each friction calculation
			+ SettingsDialog
			+ Adjust furniture values
				+ Dissect both s and k friction coeffs used
				+ Cart: per-particle, wheels very low and rest very high
			+ Test human values
		+ Exclude tungsten block from group
		+ Add random NPC
			+ Menu: "Random" as first entry to both Human and Furniture
			+ Npcs: refactor choice into function
				+ Call from AddGroup
			+ Tool and GameController --> Npcs::BeginAdd: SubKindId optional
		+ Redo placement
			+ Shouldn't impart all that velocity when leaving
				! It's the seco'd following primary's new position and thus gaining that velocity
				+ Plan:
					+ Clamp V for those moved @ Move
					+ Clamp V for those updated @ Update
				X 2: move spring forcing _after_ update
			+ Move NpcUpdate code to own helper
			! Problem analysis:
				! When we enter UpdateNpc for a non-achored particle, deltaPos already contains a humongous - albeit 
			+ Fold auto-detection
			+ Spring length maintenance: each vertex should also spar with anchor
			+ Test:
				+ WholeMesh
			+ Cleanups
				+ ClampPlacementVelocity to vec2f
		+ MainFrame: first call to ReconciliateAddNpcSubItems will check both furniture and human
			+ Need to only check the one kind whose tool is selected (if any)
			+ See if Recon() may take ToolType as arg

	+ See optimization for OrthoMatrix @ ShipRenderContext

	+ Perlin noise on Land
		+ Figure out first if can have single-float 2D texture: RED channel only?
		+ Figure out current 2 noise textures vs texture unit
		+ Noise.cpp -> Buffer<float>
			+ Optimize: 74ms -> 44ms
				+ 1 cell pos for each cell -> 32ms -> 30/31ms -> 28/30ms
				+ Linearized 1 -> 24/25ms
			+ Returns Buffer<float>
				+ Move image-making into MainFrame, at MakeNoise()
				+ 15/16ms
		+ Arch:
			+ WorldRenderContext:
				+ Members:
					+ Owns the Perlin noise OpenGL texture (handle)
					+ uq_ptr<FloatBuffer> mLandNoiseToUpload
				+ static uq_ptr<FloatBuffer> MakeLandNoise(RenderParameters)
					+ Do
				+ Initialize: nothing; render params will be dirty hence it will call ApplyLandNoiseChanges(renderParameters) which, if in HighQuality mode, will create land noise
					+ Verify
				+ New LandRenderDetailType, like OceanRenderDetailType
					+ SettingsDialog
					+ Use it to compare perf
				+ ProcessParameterChanges:
					+ If affected RenderParameters dirty || mLandNoiseToUpload:
						+ ApplyLandNoiseChanges()
				+ ApplyLandNoiseChanges:
					+ Dealloc mLandNoise (if any)
					+ If RenderMode is HighQuality:
						+ If mLandNoiseToUpload is none: mLandNoiseToUpload = MakeLandNoise(RenderParameters) // Only place where we do "inline"
						+ Alloc new mLandNoise OpenGL buffer and upload
							+ Texture: one single float (see CloudShadows)
						+ mLandNoiseToUpload.reset()
				+ OnReset(RenderParameters)
					+ Called by RenderContext::Reset() (synchronously but on render thread)
					+ If HighQuality: mLandNoiseToUpload = MakeLandNoise(RenderParameters)
				+ RenderDrawOceanFloor:
					+ Choose which of four programs
					+ If HighQuality: activate texture unit, bind texture
				+ Apply view changes et al.
					+ Apply to all (new) land shaders
		+ Shader:
			+ Split Texture and Flat in two (non-detailed, detailed) - unless already done
			+ Use one or the other depending on HighQuality Rendering mode
			+ Shader code
				+ Experiments:
					+ Only darken dark areas
					+ Derivatives for fake "bumps"
		+ Test:
			+ Hiccup when changing render quality
		+ Cleanup shader
		+ Commit
		+ Extras:
			+ Try it on clouds as well:
				+ Prototype: simply bind to texture @ CloudRender, and update shader
				+ Adjust growth parameter: use time
				X Test another noise
				+ Cleanup code if want to keep it
					+ Remove TextureCenterPos from vertex attribs
					+ Cleanup shader
		+ Merge into npcs_v1

	+ AtlasBuilder: detect duplicates
		+ New option
		+ Use at NPC baking options
		+ AtlasBuilder:
			+ BuildSpecification:
				+ Disallow option @ Regular
				+ TextureLocationInfo contains additional vector with dupe info (FrameId of DB, FrameId original that this is a dupe of)
			+ BuildAtlas:
				+ Visit two vectors separately
					+ Second visit searches (linearly...) in allAtlasFrameMetadata for FrameId original, clones, and adds
		+ Unit tests
		+ Test
	
	+ Remove too much logging from ShipLoadDialog
	+ Merchandise link
	+ Version on splash screen

	+ Send build for testing
	
	+ Bump up version
	+ MaxNpcs=2048

	+ Fix all 2022 copyright years (big #define?), and add g2-labs to:
		+ Credits
		+ Resource files x 2

	+ New tool: lamp
		! Gist: 
			! Affects DepthDarkening and AmbientLight shading
			! Param in all shaders using the above: vec4 paramLampAttributes: position (vec2 in frag space), radius (float), toggle (float, 0/1)
			! Shaders call lamp.glsinc::CalculateLampFactor(frag coords, param) -> float, and then pass float to DepthDarkening and/or AmbientLight funcs/local calculations

	+ Quad rendering with indices
		+ Sharing VBOs (for indices) in VAOs: 
			! https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/4623/multiple-vao-share-a-vbo
				! Binding the (GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER) buffer ties it to the currently bound VAO
			! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23542355/using-a-vertex-buffer-in-two-different-vertex-array-objects
				! You can bind the ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER in the setup as well. That binding is part of the VAO state
			+ Idea: one single "TriangleQuadElementArrayVBO" VBO for all render contexts, created and initialized in GlobalRenderContext, and passed
			  to all child contextes via cctor - as non-const &
				+ New class in OpenGL lib: TriangleQuadElementArrayVBO
					+ Wraps VBO (private) and local buffer (BoundedVector, private)
						+ VBO created in static factory (read below, instance of TriangleQuadElementArrayVBO is deferred-init'd as uq_ptr)
					+ Exposes void ensure_size(# of quads)
						+ If # of quads > current: enlarge & populate local buffer, flag as dirty
						+ Starts empty
					+ static Create() -> uq_ptr
						+ Creates VBO
					+ Exposes IsDirty()
					+ Exposes Bind()
					+ Exposes Upload()
						+ Binds and uploads
				+ Copy from BaryLab
				+ One single instance owned by GlobalRenderContext, as uq_ptr (w/deferred creation via static Create())
					+ At GlobalRenderContext::cctor() (verify doable)
				+ Accessed by child contextes via GlobalRenderContext
				+ GlobalContext does:
					+ @ Own setup: create it - via static Create() -> uq_ptr -> member
					+ @RenderPrepare: if TriangleQuadElementArrayVBO.IsDirty: Upload()
				+ Child contextes do:	
					+  @ VAO Setups: Bind() (though pointless because of Intel bug)
					+ Own Upload(): ensure_size(# of quads)
					+ Own RenderDraw: Bind() (because of Intel bug)
		+ Test with bubbles
			+ Prepare baseline with old dell and new dell

				+ After: upload=0.24/0.25/0.26 render=6.2/6.3
			+ Old Dell:

		+ If works, other candidates:
			+ Text (NotificationContext)
			+ Flames
			+ Clouds
			+ Generic textures
			+ Fishes

	+ Flames shader:
		! fract is always positive
		+ Dead center clamping is wrong - gets multiplier by tile size
			+ Try: incorporate it in AtlasTileSize, in shader
			+ If ok: get rid of param and adjust AtlasTileSize
				+ Simplify shader
				+ Comments for dead center being included
		+ Check why texture is truncated above (to test: set alpha = sampled texture alpha)
			! Shadertoy
			! Observations:
				! Neighbor, full texture (512x128): this repeats with zero artifacts:
				    c = vec2(
					(flameSpacePosition.x + 1.) / 2.,
					fract(flameSpacePosition.y * 2.0));					
				    dy=0.0; // Note: with dy=0.5/128.0 there _are_ artifacts

				    fragColor = texture(
					iChannel0, 
					paramAtlasTile1LeftBottomTextureCoordinates + paramAtlasTile1Size * c);
				! Linear, full texture (512x128): above repeats with minimal artifacts - good enough!
				! Linear, calculated texture (1024x256): this repeats with more artifacts - dubious if good enough:
					! It's the "linear" issue
				    c = vec2(
					(flameSpacePosition.x + 1.) / 2.,
					fract(flameSpacePosition.y * 2.0));
					
				    dx=0.5 / 1024.0;

				    fragColor = texture(
					iChannel0, 
					paramAtlasTile1LeftBottomTextureCoordinates + paramAtlasTile1Size * c);
			+ Texture:
				+ Linear, calculated texture (1024x256) with "repeat" trick:
					+ Texture trick: repeated lines above and below
						- 126 H
						- Make 0-126 x 2 (i.e. 0-252)
						- Apply dark BG
						- Smooth seam with brush
						- Copy upper half of below (126 +63) to top
						- Trim to top 126
						- Save
						- Test (double canvas - to 252, copy & paste - verify no seam) - then undo
							- Back to H=126
						- Enlarge canvas to 128
						- Duplicate top and bottom rows
						- Save
						- Test (double canvas - to 256, copy & paste - verify no seam) - then undo
							- Back to H=128
						- Import into Fire.psd and work it
						- Since you're here, see if can apply that "contrast" in shader to image as a style
						- Since you're here, make alpha channel repeatable as well
						- Save to both png's
				+ Problem with alpha truncation at top

	+ ShipBuilder: see issue with copy'n'paste of electrical materials losing instance ID
		! Repro: Copy (instanced), paste+commit, Copy it, paste+commit, Undo
			! ModelController::RestoreElectricalRegion: dupe instance ID
			! Note: problem is NOT in panel, but in electrical elements' instance IDs
			! Problem is: we don't renumber instance IDs in buffer at Paste 
				! i.e. at element operator in ModelController::Paste
				! Because element operator does not update instance ID in buffer
		+ Fix:
			+ DoElectricalRegionBufferPaste's operator returns electrical element by value
			+ Caller (Paste) returns modified electrical element
		! No other cases seems like

	+ Send for final testing

	+ See AlexGuy crash/repair tool
		X Play
		+ Give it RelWithDebInfo/PDB
		+ I load any ship, like for example Astyu's Ise, Agano or Akitsu Maru. I blow a hole in the hull through a simulated torpedo hit or magazine explosion, usually done with the RC bombs or heating tool.
		  Then i use the repair tool. If held long enough, the game crashes.
		  This happened even in 18.0.
                  It happens in Astyu's ships.
                  Specifically those with compartments and magazine cordite modelled in.
                  I sent the .dmp file.

			! Goal: predictably tied to real blast radius
			+ ShipRenderContext uses empirically texture-determined radius multipliers to focus "core" fireball in frame
			+ Ship::StartExplosion: also takes gfx radius offset for added spectacularity
				+ Names: BlastRadius, RenderRadiusOffset

				+ But solve problem of going to other texture: need more room around textures?
					+ Cannot clamp in shader: would still look awful, and nice to have long flanges

					+ Heat is already negative
			+ Give type to World::OnBlast
			+ RenderUpload
			+ Tests:
				+ Force blast on NPCs
			+ Too much heat removed: ship goes to -30,000K!
				! Just change temperature of particle directly to half ignition temperature
				+ Heat removed from bomb: little (not that x10 multiplier) - or even zero
				+ If fire-extinguishing: change temperature of particle directly to half ignition temperature
				+ Test (on Ship only):
					+ Explosion on non-burning point: verify temperature
					+ Explosion on burning point: verify temperature and smothering
		+ ShipRenderContext: uploaded via existing UploadExplosion
			+ Switch case in UploadExplosion on ExplosionType
			+ Explosions shader with variator (much like yellowing)
